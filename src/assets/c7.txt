>FADE IN:

EXT. FLOATING HIGH ABOVE THE EARTH - DAY

The curve of our planet from near-space.  Rain and wind push clouds in swirling kaleidoscopes of color and light.

A slow rumbling that quickly crescendos into a blast of rocket engines.  The rocket hurtles past us as jet fire fills the frame and is gone.

An astronaut's headgear shaking violently.  The shapes and colors of high-Earth reflected in the curved glass of the helmet.

RILEY (V.O.)
They told me I would be gone for three months.

We see a face too.  This is JAMES RILEY.  Lieutenant, Third Division.

CUT TO:

EXT. THE ALIEN PLANET OF GILI - DAY

A small fighter-craft hurtles through the red and yellow clouds of the Gili atmosphere.  Riley pilots.

The craft drops below the clouds and over a range of jagged alien mountains.  In the distance a small Gili city is being attacked on all sides from fighter-craft just like this one.

Riley drops in closer.  Taps at his targeting computer.  A missile falls from the under-carriage of his ship and speeds towards the city.

RILEY (V.O.)
That was a year and a half ago.

ABOVE THE CITY

Fire and explosions.  Riley's craft comes in low through the smoke.  Firing blasts of lasers at the already burning buildings.

The Gili aliens, their bodies smooth and red.  Humanoid with large blue eyes.  Men, women, children.  They are scattered dead on the roadways or are running for their lives.

Riley pulls up.  Flies back into the clouds.

  

RILEY (V.O.)
The enemy we were told, was hostile and deadly.

EXT. GILI CITY - DAY

Marines now.  Shoulder to shoulder walking through the smouldering alien city.  Rifles raised and firing at anything that moves.

The aliens are running for their lives or are shot dead where they stand.  Their strange cries, haunting and bird-like.

A group of six marines corral a group of a dozen aliens against a wall.  The marines are smiling, laughing with each other.  Like this is just another day at the office.

The aliens are huddled together.

The squad commander flicks his cigarette on the ground and nods at two younger marines.

The two younger marines raise their rifles and start firing.

Automatic bursts of laser-fire tear in and through the aliens.  There is shrieking and screaming as they aliens drop to the ground, dead and burning.

RILEY (V.O.)
But we all knew who the real enemy was.

INT. RILEY'S SHIP - DAY

Riley flying back over the killing fields.

Columns of smoke and fire.  Collapsed and broken buildings. Bodies.  Hundreds or thousands strewn about.  Broken, dead and dying.

Riley watches as this vision of hell passes him by.

Pulls back into the clouds.

INT. PSYCH OFFICE - ORBITAL STAGING AREA

A clean and sparsely decorated office.  Windows on all sides behind which is the blackness of space.

DR. KANAKA is the psychiatrist.  A younger Asian man whose smile hardly conceals his smug nature.  Kanaka is leaned back in his chair.  Peering at Riley over his tablet.

  

KANAKA
Honestly?  I'm not liking what I'm hearing.

RILEY
I'm just wondering what my options are, that's all.

Kanaka squints, not believing what he's hearing.

KANAKA
Your options?   We're at war lieutenant.

Riley looks out the windows.  Down at the planet below.

RILEY
Is that what you call it?  War?

Looks back to Kanaka.

RILEY
I didn't sign up for this.  Not for this.

KANAKA
Well actually you did.  I can show you if you like.

Kanaka keys at his tablet.  Offers the tablet to Riley.  That same smug look in his eyes.

Riley knows Kanaka is right.

RILEY
No.

Kanaka drops the tablet on the table between them.  On the tablet's screen is Riley's picture and service contract.  At the bottom is a scan of Riley's thumb print.

KANAKA
Then I suggest you forget all this and return to duty. You're very close to a NO-STAT rating as it is and if the brass ever got wind of this--

RILEY
I thought these meetings were confidential?

Kanaka smiles at Riley again.  This time we don't see smugness, but contempt.

  

INT. BARRACKS - DAY

Empty except for Riley sitting on the edge of his bunk. Riley is leaned over, resting on his knees and looking at the floor.

Footsteps approaching.

From Riley's POV we see only the combat boots of someone walking towards him.  They stop in front of Riley.

MAN'S VOICE (O.S.)
So you coming to work today Bato, or what?

Riley looks up.

TAZO is a 30s Hispanic man with a kind face.  He's in a tan flight suit.

Riley studies him.

TAZO
Cause the old man sent me in here to get you.  Not only that but he sent two Reapers with me.

Riley looks to the end of the barracks.  Two guards in black and silver uniforms with assault rifles are silhouetted in the doorway.

TAZO
They're about this far from dropping you off at camp, mi amigo.

Riley nods.  Stands up.

RILEY
So lets go to work.

AT THE DOORWAY

Riley and Tazo arrive in front of the Reaper-guards.  The guards glare at Riley but don't move.

Riley glares back.

FIRST GUARD
We have orders to take you in Lieutenant if you're not on the tarmac by zero-nine hundred this morning.

  

RILEY
So get the fuck out of my way.

The guards hold for a beat and then stand aside.

EXT. AIRCRAFT HANGAR - DAY

Rows of fighter craft a hundred deep disappear down the tarmac.

Riley climbs a ladder and enters the cockpit of his fighter. The glass above him closes.

In the ship next to Riley is Tazo.  Tazo offers a quick salute.  Riley salutes back and puts on his helmet.

On the panel in front of him a clearance signal flashes green. Riley keys in a take-off sequence and the jet rumbles and shakes as the engines engage.

The jet lifts off vertically.

The craft raises higher, and higher.  A few hundred feet up and still climbing.   Beside him and on all sides other craft are climbing too.  Then one by one the other craft rocket forward and are lost in the clouds.

Riley takes the flight stick in his hand.

Pushes it ahead.

The ship kicks forward in a blast and disappears into the red and yellow clouds.

INT. RILEY'S FIGHTER - DAY

Riley flying high through the alien atmosphere.

On the mapping display is a GPS with an indicator on the map blinking red.

Riley's ship comes out of the clouds.  Now we see on both sides of him, a dozen other fighter jets.

In the distance another Gili city.

SKY ONE (O.S.)
(on headset)
You know the name of the game gentleman.  This is a no quarter given, no man standing, full contact night at the ball.

  

  
We've got approximately seven thousand of these ugly red bastards up ahead and I want them all eating dirt before lunch.

The city approaching.

On Riley's wing Tazo flies close.  Riley and Tazo see each other through the glass of their cockpits.

TAZO
(in headset)
You okay, Bato?

A long beat as Riley holds his gaze on Tazo.

Then.  Riley pulls back on the flight stick.  His craft lowers.  Dropping out of formation.

The rest of squadron continues on and are in the clouds.

CUT TO:

.OVER A GILI JUNGLE

Riley's craft speeding now over the canopy of a lush green jungle.  The jungle carries on in all directions and disappears into the horizon.

Radio static.

SKY ONE (O.S.)
Seventeen this is Sky One.  Please return to formation.  Do you copy? Over.

Riley accelerates.  The green foliage below him just a dizzying blur.  There is something painful in Riley's expression.

A suicidal bent.

SKY ONE (O.S.)
Seventeen this is Sky One.  Please return to formation.  Do you--

Riley turns off the radio.

Riley steers his craft lower.  The bottom of the ship rattles along the top of the jungle canopy.  Riley, grappling with the flight stick as he plays this dangerous game.

Voices now, as Riley replays this conversation in his head.

  

KARL RILEY (O.S)
I'm not going to tell you what you should do.  This is a decision you have to make alone.

JAMES RILEY (O.S)
Well, I've already made up my mind.

KARL RILEY (O.S)
I'm just saying that you got to have a reason for doing anything.

JAMES RILEY (O.S)
I have reason enough.

Now we hear the sounds of war. Still from Riley's memory. Gunfire and grenades.  Tanks and mortar shells exploding.

The haunting screams of the dying and the dead.

KARL RILEY (O.S)
I'm just saying that you got to have a reason for doing anything.

JAMES RILEY (O.S)
I have reason enough.

The fighter craft drops lower.  Under the treeline now and into the Gili jungle.

The foliage rattles and cracks against the body of the fighter as it barrels forward.  Further into a certain extinction.

The glass canopy on the fighter cracks.  The ship spins out of control. Heads into the darkness.

!FLASH CUT TO:

GILI FIELD

A young woman stands in a field of tall green grass.  She is pretty with a kind, soft smile.  The woman has dark hair and dark eyes.

This is SARA TRAINER.

Behind the woman alien clouds paint pictures in the sky.

SARA (O.S.)
Look at me.

Now above Sara, we see a bright blazing light.

  

SARA (O.S.)
I am waiting for you here.

!FLASH CUT TO:

RILEY'S SHIP

As it rattles and groans.  Spinning and falling.  The heavy tress ripping into the hull.  The glass canopy is ripped off and knifelike shards of glass explode everywhere.

SARA (O.S.)
I am waiting for you here.

Riley reaches for the eject lever.  Pulls it.

An explosion under Riley as the ejector seat blasts upwards.

The fighter craft spins careening into the jungle and explodes in a rage of jet fuel.

Riley spins sideways as the parachute misfires.

He tumbles into the jungle, skipping through the tops of the tree.  Pummeled and battered against the jungle foliage.

Everything goes dark.

INT. INTERROGATION ROOM - NIGHT

Dreamscape.  Nothing is in focus here for long.  Shapes and colors shift and blend.  Visible and then not.

Sitting across from Riley is the snakelike figure of WILSON. Wilson is an agent for the Amicus corporation.  A dark suit with intense black eyes.

Riley's hands are bound behind him.

WILSON
What do you remember?

RILEY
I've told you.  Nothing.

WILSON
After your ship went down you remember nothing?

RILEY
That's right.

  

WILSON
What if I said we didn't believe you?

RILEY
Well you can say what you want, can't you?  It doesn't change the facts.

Wilson nods.

WILSON
You're right.  A fact is a fact. Unchangeable and irrevocable.

Wilson drags his chair across the floor, nearer to Riley. Sits back down.  Leans in.

WILSON
Like the fact of pain, Lieutenant. Physical pain.  I think you'll agree it's a fact we all have to deal with at some point in our lives.

Wilson picks up a long pointed instrument from a tray table. A thin stainless-steel spike with a sliver handle.  We'll call it an icepick.

Riley sees it too.  Shifts in his chair but has nowhere to go.

RILEY
I've told you what I know.

Wilson nods.

WILSON
Maybe you have.  Maybe you have not.  There is a third possibility Lieutenant and that is that maybe you do not know what... you... know...

Wilson takes the icepick.   Touches the tip into the hollow of Riley's shoulder.  Hovers over Riley.  Looks into Riley's eyes.

WILSON
How did you get back to Earth after the accident?  There was no mention of you on any ship manifest.

10.

Riley stares into Wilson's dark eyes and knows what is coming.

Wilson pushes the icepick in.

Riley screams.  His eyes close.  Wilson leans harder on the icepick.  It goes in further.  Riley screams louder.

Gasping.

His eyes open.

Then.  Something like a red liquid is introduced into the whites of Riley's eyes.  Riley's pupils expand into large black discs.

His eyes now, wide and black and blood red.  There is something too, looking through these eyes.  Something not human.

Something alien.

CUT TO:

EXT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE - DAY

An old house on forgotten farm land.

On a porch-swing. A young man (RIANN) looks out across the lush landscape.  On his lap is an MP7 Heckler & Koch assault pistol.

INT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE - DAY

An upstairs bedroom.  An old crib in the corner.  Faded and peeling wallpaper.  Dusty sunlight streams in through the broken windows.

In the middle of the room is a table.  Sitting at the table are PEYTON ARGYLE (30s), SARA TRAINER (27) and ERHARD HESSE (80s).

Peyton is a shifty, nervous looking man is a tan field jacket and a short army-stlye buzzcut.  He's sitting across from Sara.

Sara is adjusting a camera on a tripod beside the table. Sara has dark hair, dark eyes.  She's focused and pretty with a soft smile.

PEYTON
Should I look at you, or look at the camera?

11.

SARA
You can look at me.

The other man here is Erhard Hesse.  Hesse is sitting quietly at the edge of the table.  Hesse has white hair and clear shining eyes.  Hesse's hands are resting on a closed aluminum briefcase.

SARA
(to Peyton)
So we are going to do this in two parts, okay?  First we'll ask you the questions about Gili.  About what you saw there, what you witnessed.  After that, Dr. Hesse is going to hook you up to the machine, and hopefully... Well you know what we're aiming for.

We see now in Peyton is holding a dark blue and red gemstone. Peyton runs his fingers over the smooth surface.

PEYTON
So we're going to start now?

SARA
If you're ready.

PEYTON
How many interviews have you done... like this?

SARA
You're the first interview out of six known subjects.  And now that Amicus has stopped sending troops home you'll likely be the last.

PEYTON
Amicus killed the others, didn't they?

Sara look on Peyton softly.

SARA
Yes, I'm afraid they did.

Behind them.  A guard with an AK-47 stands by the door.

EXT. COUNTRY ROAD - DAY

A sun-bleached Range Rover winds through sprawling farm lands.

12.

INT. RANGE ROVER - CONTINUOUS

Driver is DELVIN GRIGGS. A thirtysomething war-worn revolutionary.  Delvin has been fighting the good fight for a long time but lately it's been starting to show.

Passenger is EM KASTING. Seventeen year old waif-of-a-thing best imagined as a cross between Alice Cooper and Alice-in-Wonderland.  Cute with-a-kick.

Em has her feet up on the dash.  A small plastic unicorn with a silver horn hangs from the boot laces.

INT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE - DAY

Peyton looks across the table at Sara.

PEYTON
It started a few at first. Soldiers who said they were tired of killing.  Said they weren't gonna do it no more.  Refused to show up for duty.  Refused to carry a weapon.  Stopped following orders, some of them completely.

Peyton looks out the window of the house as a crow lands on the roof outside.  Peyton watches it for a beat and then back to Sara.

PEYTON
It was about then the brass introduced K-STAT.  A number given each of one of us.  Went from low numbers-- one, two--  right up to ten or twelve or higher.

SARA
And what was it for?

PEYTON
Basically it meant how willing you are to kill.  Got a higher number means you kill easier.  Lower number means you're soft.  Scared.

SARA
And what happened when your number dropped too low?

PEYTON
If your number dropped below three brass called it a NO-STAT.

13.

  
Means you were now more of liability to the mission than anything.  Amicus had built these camps.  Detention camps.  Housed all the NO-STAT there.

SARA
Did you ever talk to anyone who was inside the camps?

PEYTON
Some came back, yeah.  Once in awhile.  But when they did they were different.

SARA
Different, how?

PEYTON
They came back with a look in their eyes they ain't never had when they left.  Like they seen something they'd rather not of seen.  Or shouldn't have.

A beat.

PEYTON
Most didn't come back though.  My guess is most died in those camps.

EXT. FARM HOUSE GATE - DAY

Em is outside the Range Rover.  Knee high in weeds as she pulls open the wrought iron gate.

DOWN THE LANEWAY

Following the truck as it idles slowly towards the house.

IN FRONT OF THE HOUSE

The Range Rover arrives and stops.  The porch is empty.  The swing rocks in the breeze.

INSIDE THE RANGE ROVER

Em leans forward gazing at the empty porch.  Concern.

EM
Where's Riann?

14.

INT. ABANDONED FARM HOUSE - DAY

The creaking of old stairs as we follow a pair of boots slowly ascending.

Riann.  The boy from the porch reaches the top of the stairs. He raps on the door.  The H&K machine pistol at his side.

The door opens a crack.  The guard with the AK peers out.

GUARD
What?

RIANN
How's the interview going?

GUARD
Are you kidding me?

RIANN
No.

GUARD
Get the hell back downstairs.

The door begins to close.  Riann jams in his pistol.

RIANN
Give me a light, first.

GUARD
Fuck off, I said.

RIANN
Come on, just a light.

GUARD
You stupid fucker.  Get--

And then.  TAP-TAP-TAP-TAP as the boy's pistol ignites.

The guard reels back and out of frame.  We hear the guard fall to the floor.

The door creaks open.

OUTSIDE THE HOUSE

The Range Rover rolls to a stop.

INSIDE THE HOUSE

Sara is standing now against a wall, frozen with fear.

15.

Peyton is still seated at the table.  Hands up over his head.

Erhard still sits with his hands folded on the briefcase.  He watches Riann, closely.

Riann crosses to the guard who's laid out on the floor.

The guard is gasping and holding his neck.  Blood spews from between the guard's fingers as he tries to put pressure on the wound.

Riann steps down on the guard's rifle.  Squints at the guard who is bleeding and choking on the floor.  The guards gasps and sputters a few more times.  Dies.

Riann turns.  Looks now on Peyton.  Raises the machine pistol at him.

RIANN
Stand up.

Peyton stands.

RIANN
You know what a traitor is?

Peyton stares, unflinching.

PEYTON
Yes.

TAP-TAP-TAP-TAP-TAP.  Shots kick from the boy's pistol.

Peyton flails back against the wall as the blood splatters up in a fan behind him.  He falls.

Sara screams.  Hands over her mouth.

Riann turns now on Erhard.  Trains the gun on him.

Erhard stands.  Eyes burning on Riann.

ERHARD
Your evil will not reign here for long.

Riann smirks.  And the pistol ignites again.

TAP-TAP-TAP-TAP-TAP.  The bullets kick into the old man and the man falls to the floor, dead.

Sara shaking now with fear.

16.

Downstairs the door is kicked open.  Riann crosses quickly to the stairwell and peers down.  Points the machine pistol down and fires randomly.

RIANN
(shouting downstairs)
Stay down there Em!  I still have the girl here and I will make her go away if I hear you coming up those stairs.

Quiet from down the stairwell.

RIANN
You got it?

SARA
(shouting)
Stay downstairs Emma!

Riann pacing now.  Shaking his head.  Trapped and cornered like an animal.

RIANN
Em will kill me.  She'll kill me, I know it. Fucking Everbrites. Fucking Everbrites!

SARA
We can get out of this if you keep calm, Riann.

RIANN
They weren't supposed to be back for and hour.  You called them? Did you call them!

Riann raises the machine pistol at Sara.  Sara shields her face with her arms.

SARA
I didn't.  I didn't call them.

Riann holds the pistol for a beat and then lowers it.  Paces again.  Back and forth.

RIANN
I should have killed you all in the jeep.  I was in the back.  I was in the back.  I was going to do it.  I didn't want to hit Delvin.  I just would of had to-- Ah, fuck!

Riann's mind is racing.

17.

RIANN
Em can kill me if she wants to.  If Em wants to kill me then let her.

Riann focuses his gaze on Sara.

RIANN
This is the mission Sara.  We can't let them win.

Riann raises the pistol again at Sara.

The boy leans into fire.

SARA
No, Riann!  No!

CRACK. CRACK. CRACK.  Three shots explode from the stairwell. All three cut into the boy Riann.

The boy spins around and falls to the floor gasping.  A beat later and he's dead.

Em in the doorway of the stairwell.  The Glock 19 still in firing position.  Smoking in her hand.

Delvin pushes past Em towards Sara.

Sara is only half standing now.  Bent at the knees.  Her hands flat on the floor.

INT. CLINIC INFIRMARY  - NIGHT

The room is dark.  Large with high ceilings and rows of beds jammed together.  Looking down as we track along the sleeping patients.

Stopping on one.

James Riley.  As he slowly drifts into consciousness.  Riley stares up at the dim lights above him.  His hands move to his chest.  He feels something.

Peels back his shirt.

The scar runs the length of his torso from his breastplate clear down to his waist.  Raw with the stitching still intact.

Riley sits up.  The only patient awake amidst the fifty bed infirmary.

18.

INT. CLINIC COMMON AREA - NIGHT

Long, wide hallway.  Activity in here.  Nurses and patients meander on their evening.

Riley enters from a stairwell.

A nurse smiles at Riley as she passes him by.  Riley reaches for her.  Tries to say something but the nurse is already moving on.

Riley carries on further.  Uneven.  Squinting as his eyes adjust to the light.

Riley leans against the wall for balance as he walks.

TV ROOM

Riley leans on the door frame as he peers into the room.

A few patients are watching the news.

One of them is MAX DANO (40s).  A  slightly crazed looking man with long thinning hair and wild grey eyes.

Dano peers up at Riley.  We see him like we're looking through a fishbowl.

DANO
Do you believe these cockroaches?

A beat before Riley realizes someone is talking to him.

DANO
You were on Gili, huh?

Riley can't answer.  Sits down on the edge of a chair.

ON THE TV

A segment about the war on Gili.  An on-planet housing unit with perfect rows of tents as far as the eye can see.

A reporter interviews a young solider.  Bright and happy.

YOUNG SOLIDER
We all want to come home, sure. But life here is good.  As good as can be expected.  I'll tell you Amicus is doing everything they can to keep things favorable for us!

BACK IN THE ROOM

19.

Dano twitches.  Squints at the TV screen.

DANO
Favorable!!!  Favorable?!?  Who the fuck talks like that?

Dano glares up at Riley who is clearly somewhere else.

DANO
Lemmee' see your tag, buddy.

Dano grabs Riley's wrist.  Turns it upright to reveal a yellow transdermal strip with a sequence of black numbers.

Dano squints at it.  Frowns.

DANO
Officer?  There ain't no officers in this shit clinic.

Dano thrusts Riley's arm back.  Glares at him for a beat then back to the TV.

.ON THE TV

A news conference now.  The man talking into the microphone is KARL VAN SANT, CEO of the Amicus Corporation.

Riley's eyes try to focus on the screen.

VAN SANT
When we left for Gili two years ago we made a promise to the American people and a promise to the entire planet of Earth.  We will keep you safe.  We will not allow this alien invasion to happen.

.BACK IN THE TV ROOM

NURSE LEANNE is in her 40s.  A shorter round-ish woman with a mostly permanent smile.  The nurse leans into check on the patients.

NURSE LEANNE
Everyone okay in here?

The nurse holds on Riley.

NURSE LEANNE
Hey.

The nurse taps on his shoulder.

20.

NURSE LEANNE
Hey, what's your name, fella?  You okay?

Riley might be trying to say something but nothing comes out.

Now recognition in the nurse's eyes.  The nurse turns to the hallway.  Grabs another nurse by the shirt sleeve.

NURSE LEANNE
Go get Temple right now.  Tell him twenty-two is up and walking around.

INT. EXAM ROOM - NIGHT

Riley sits on the edge of a cot.  Life coming back into his eyes.

The doctor is MILES TEMPLE.  Thirties, warm features. Someone you can trust.

Temple sits in his chair, facing Riley.  Hands behind his head like he's working out a puzzle.

TEMPLE
Has anyone seen that yet?

RILEY
Seen what?

Temple gestures at Riley's wrist.

TEMPLE
Your IDC strip.

RILEY
Why?

TEMPLE
It's yellow.

Riley nods.

RILEY
I know it is.

Temple sits forward.   Studies Riley some more.

TEMPLE
I've just never seen one that color before.

21.

RILEY
All the pilots had yellow bands on Gili.

Temple studies Riley.  Smirks.

TEMPLE
And you were a pilot?

RILEY
Yeah.

TEMPLE
You were not.

RILEY
I was.  I was a pilot.  I flew kick-burner missions, mostly.

TEMPLE
You were a pilot who flew kick-burner missions, mostly?

RILEY
Yeah.

TEMPLE
On Gili?

RILEY
Yeah.

TEMPLE
So what are you doing in my clinic?

RILEY
I don't know.  I woke up here. Where should I be?

TEMPLE
Maybe upstate in one of those fancy resort hospitals Amicus builds for you all.  Having your brain rewired.

RILEY
What does that mean?

Temple studies Riley some more.  Trying to figure out if Riley is as clueless as he seems.

TEMPLE
You really don't know anything, do you?

22.

INT. CLINIC INFIRMARY - NIGHT

Dark.  Everyone is sleeping.

At Riley's bed.  Riley with eyes closed.  Fluttering.

RILEY'S DREAM

In a room with a number of people sitting around a table. Nothing is quite in focus though, vibrating too quickly.

People appear as they speak and then melt away again.

MAN
Do you think you're dreaming right now?

The man leans in.  Slender face and round glasses.

RILEY
I just remember this place.  I remember the sound of that clock.

A clock ticking louder than it should.

MAN
Have you ever heard the term Temporal Drift?

RILEY
What did you say to me?

GIRL
Temporal Drift?  Do you know what it is?

The girl too soft to make out.

RILEY
Guys on Gili were getting it. Messes with your memory, right?

MAN
Do you know what Temporal Drift is?

RILEY
What did you say to me?  It was a dream.

GIRL
Well, some people think it does more than that?

23.

RILEY
Guys on Gili were getting it. Messes with your memory, right?

The scene shifts and jumps.  Vibrating.  Forms appearing and then fading away.

RILEY
What is this place?

MAN
This is the Sentinel.  The eyes of the people.

GIRL
How did you know how to find us?

The girl is younger.  A teenager in a frayed purple hoodie and a black skirt.  The girl crosses her legs and when she does we see the figure of the plastic unicorn ties to her lace.

RILEY
I've seen you before.   All of you. I've been here.  I'm here now, aren't I?

And then a voice from further away.  Louder and humming.

WOMAN
I said, This is your heart.

MAN
The woman's name is Sara Trainer. She's a reporter.

RILEY
What did you say to me?  It was a dream.

WOMAN
I said, This is your heart.

MAN
It's like falling through a fractal isn't it?  Everything sort of wrapping around on itself.

WOMAN
We don't know how it's going to turn out.  We're just trusting that there is enough love and enough forgiveness to go around.

24.

  
Even enough for those who don't believe they deserve it.

MAN
Did they give you anything?  Do you have something, an item you don't know how you received?

CUT TO:

INT. CLINIC INFIRMARY - NIGHT

Riley sits up with a gasp.  Breathing heavily.  Reaches for something around his neck.  Feeling for it.  Pulls his collar back, searches with his hands.

Nothing.

INT. CLINIC COMMON AREA - NIGHT

The hallway is dark and empty.

Outside the nurse's station Riley bangs on the door.  He tries to open it.  Locked.  Bangs again.

Riley looks through the glass into the office.  A desk with a lamp burning but no one sitting there.

Riley tries to open the door once more.   Still locked.

Movement from the hallway.

Riley sees the short round form of Nurse Leanne silhouetted in the darkness.  The nurse puts her hands on her hips.

.MOMENTS LATER

Nurse Leanne has the office keys and is unlocking the door.

INSIDE THE NURSE'S STATION

At at a filing cabinet the nurse opens a drawer.  Pudgy fingers moving though stacks of files.

Riley stands beside her.

The nurse stops on one file.  An manila envelope, labeled Patient #134.

NURSE LEANNE
This is you.

25.

On the desk.  The nurse empties the contents of the envelope. A silver watch, a set of keys, a silver chain with a blue stone set into a silver bezel.

Riley goes for the stone.   Picks it up.

RILEY
I had this when I came in?

NURSE LEANNE
Everything in the envelope is yours, love.

Riley hold the gem stone under the lamp.  Round, smooth. Dark blue spiralling to red.

NURSE LEANNE
It's beautiful.  What is it?

RILEY
That's what I need to find out.

EXT. MERCY CARE CENTER - MOMENTS LATER

A black van parked halfway down the street.

INT. BLACK VAN - NIGHT

In the passenger seat is Dano.  The scraggly man with the wild grey eyes.

In the drivers seat is Wilson.  The sharp looking suit with the trimmed black hair and the blank expression.

In the back seat is BRADLEY.  Same suit.  Same haircut.  Same blank look on his face.

DANO
He was in there tonight, watching Turn of Destiny.

WILSON
Turn of Destiny.

DANO
It's that game show where you have to figure out--

WILSON
I know what it is.

DANO
So you gonna pay me now or what?

26.

WILSON
You're certain it was a yellow band?

DANO
I may be crazy but I ain't color-blind.

WILSON
Yeah, we're going to pay you now.

INT. MERCY CARE CENTER - NIGHT

The two agents enter the clinic.  They stand shoulder-to-shoulder under the dim fluorescents.

Down the hallway nurse Leanne locks up the nurse's station.

The agents step down the hallway towards the nurse.  The nurse sees the agents and crosses to meet them.

NURSE LEANNE
Visiting hours are over for this evening, gentleman.

A beat as Wilson studies the nurse.

WILSON
Do we looks like fucking visitors?

The nurse takes a beat.  The smile on her face wiped clean.

NURSE
Excuse me?

BRADLEY
He said shut the fuck up and let us and let us do the talking.

Nurse Leanne's hands begins to shake at her side.

NURSE
Who are you?

WILSON
Who are we?

Wilson turns to Bradley.

WILSON
Did she just ask another question?

NURSE LEANNE
No, I was just...

27.

Bradley reaches.  Grabs the nurse by the throat.  Pushes her against the wall.  Tears now in the nurse's eyes.

NURSE LEANNE
No.  No, please.  I'll answer what you want.

Wilson removes a silver M9 Beretta handgun from his jacket. Attaches a silencer to the barrel.

WILSON
Yes, I'm sure that you will.

Wilson peers into the nurse's eyes.  The gun at his side.

WILSON
Do you have a patient here with a yellow IDC strip?

The nurse reflects.

NURSE LEANNE
Uhm...  I...  I'd have to check in the...   the..

Wilson puts the gun to the flesh of the nurse's side.   Pulls the trigger and gun kicks.

The nurse lets out a scream.  Wilson covers her mouth.

WILSON
Shut up.

Wilson pushes his hand hard over the nurse's mouth.  The nurse is crying and heaving.

WILSON
That one was in and out.  Probably missed your kidney.

Wilson raises the pistol to the nurses head.

WILSON
Now think carefully because the next one will go between your eyes.

Wilson is dead serious.

WILSON
Do you have a patient here with a yellow IDC tag?  He goes by the name of James Riley.

The nurse nods her head, yes.

28.

WILSON
Excellent.  Now where would this James Riley be?

Movement now at the end of the hallway.  A silhouette of a man stands frozen like a deer caught in headlights.

Wilson locks on him.  Let's go of the nurse.  Takes a step toward the man.

WILSON
Hey.

The silhouette takes a step back and under a light.

Riley.

Wilson steps towards Riley.  Eyes fixed.

WILSON
(to the nurse without looking at her)
Is that him?

The nurse nods.  Crying.

NURSE LEANNE
Yes.

Riley see's the silver flash of Wilson's pistol.

WILSON
We just want to talk to you.

Riley takes another step back.

Wilson raises the Beretta.  The gun kicks twice.  One shot tears through the door jam by Riley's head, shattering it.

The other shot goes wide.

Riley stumbles back.  Turning as he scrambles forward and through a door.

Wilson takes off running down the hallway.

Bradley, beside the nurse.

The nurse, bleeding from her side.  Holding it.  Tears and blood and fear.

Bradley removes a pistol from under his jacket.

Raises at the nurse's head.

29.

INT. STAIRWELL - CONTINUOUS

Riley moving as fast as he can down  the concrete stairwell when... CRACK CRACK CRACK

Riley looks up.  See's a flash of the agent Wilson through the hollow in the stairs.

Riley bursts out a door and into a dark alley between the buildings.

.ON WILSON - CONTINUOUS

As he follows down the stairway.  Relentless.  Around the last turn and towards the door.

EXT. ALLEY - CONTINUOUS

Wilson bursts out the exit.  Pistol in hand.  Looks up and down the alley.

Darkness.  Rain.

Riley, gone.

EXT. LAKE IN THE MOUNTAINS - DAY

Dreamscape.

Sara stands on the edge of a lake, wide and dark blue.

Across the lake and far away are a range of majestic glacial mountains.

Sara peer out across the water.  We'll see her only from behind now.  A tableau.  Still and wide.

SARA (V.O)
What am I going to tell you that will make a difference?  To stay here and not to go?  Not to step into that office on that cold day. To look closely at what were they are trying to sell you and closer still at what were you trying to buy?  Couldn't you hear me calling at you across that divide?  Didn't you know where I was?  That I was waiting?

Sara steps into lake.  The water washes over her feet.

30.

SARA (V.O)
I know that we have never met but I have known you always.  I have called to you by your name and you have heard me and hear me still. There is a power in you James Riley that you have yet to discover.  A stillness and a graceful ferocity that will carry you from the depths of shadow to the very heights of your true-self. Your heart beats for all of us now and when we meet finally in this place, you will know why... and you will believe.

INT. SUBWAY CAR - NIGHT

The train rattles through the tunnels under the city.

Riley is alone in the car.  Asleep.

EXT. CITY STREETS - DAWN

Riley walks the streets.  The city is waking up.

EXT. NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY - DAY

Establishing shot.

INT. LIBARY / ROSE READING ROOM - DAY

A massive cathedral style room with wide arching windows and light pouring in.  Above are huge glass chandeliers.  The walls lined with leather bound books.

Thirty or so tables all with computers and most of them occupied.   At one of them is Riley.

On the screen.  Riley brings up a search window.

Types : SENTINAL, EYES OF THE PEOPLE

The search query returns list of items.  The first is a listing for the organization's website.  Riley taps on the link.

The screen flashes : SITE BANNED DUE TO ILLEGAL CONTENT

The next link down is a news article from The Times.  It reads: SENTINAL PAPER TO CLOSE

Riley taps on the link. The Times article appears.  Riley scrolls through the text scanning it quickly.  Taps on a photo on the screen.  The photo expands.

31.

The photo is of a protest in an urban residential neighbourhood.  The streets are full of mostly young people holding protest signs.

The protest is happening in front of a large brick building.

The caption on the photo reads : STUDENTS PROTEST IN THE ARTS DISTRICT AS CLOSURE OF SENTINAL LOOMS

Riley zooms in on the placard above the doors of the building.

It reads : HAMPTON COURT APARTMENTS

EXT. HAMPTON ARTS DISTRICT - DAY

The streets are wide and clean.  Coffee shops, converted warehouses, green spaces.  A once industrial area is now urban and hip.

Riley crosses the street.

In front of the Hampton Court Apartments, a group of three teenage hipsters are sitting on the steps laughing and talking.

Two boys and a girl.

Riley stops in front of them.  They continue talking amongst themselves.  One of the boys (BOY #1) looks up at Riley through locks of blonde hair.

BOY #1
Hey, man.

Riley is standing in the sun.  The girl shades her eyes and peers at him.

GIRL
Whatca need, daddy-o?

Riley hesitates a beat.

RILEY
I'm looking for The Sentinel Observer.

The other boy smirks.

BOY #2
The Sentinel?  Keep looking man. They keep that place under wraps.

32.

The girl still squinting at Riley.  The girl looks on him like he's some lost dog that needs to find his way home.

The girls holds on Riley for a beat longer.

GIRL
You know where the SkyRunner Cafe is?

The blonde boy sneers at the girl.

BOY #1
Maybe you should just keep your mouth shut, Lynn.

LYNN
He's harmless.  I can tell.  You're harmless, right?

RILEY
Yeah.

LYNN
See.

Lynn smiles.

LYNN
Skyrunner Cafe.  There's a girl that works there that used to write for The Sentinel.  Maybe still does.  I think her name was...

Lynn searches for the name but can't get it.  She elbows the blonde boy next to her.

BOY #1
Hey name was Allie.

LYNN
Yeah, Allie.  Crazy purple hair and cute as a button.  You can't miss her.

EXT. SKYRUNNER CAFE - DAY

The cafe is on the corner of a quiet intersection under the shade of a large elm.  The patio is wide and half full of mostly young people reading and drinking coffee.

Riley enters.

33.

INT. SKYRUNNER CAFE - DAY

Inside are a dozen wooden tables.  A chalk board with menu items like vegetarian quinoa chili and organic turkey melts.

The girl behind the counter is spunky and cute with piercings and blue and purple hair. She's humming to herself while she puts away dishes from the drying rack.

Riley steps to the counter.

The girl turns to greet him with a smile.

ALLIE
Howdy-ho, partner.

Riley smiles.

RILEY
You're Allie?

ALLIE
I am too.

Riley studies her for a beat.

RILEY
Do you work for The Sentinel?  Did you?

The girl smirks at Riley.  Not sure what to make of him. Goes back to putting away the dishes.

ALLIE
You a cop?

RILEY
No.

ALLIE
If you were would you tell me?

RILEY
I guess not.

ALLIE
What do you want to know about the Sentinel?

RILEY
How about, where are they are located?

34.

ALLIE
Ha!  You are a cop.

The girl laughs.  Leans over the counter as she wipes it down.

Then Riley see something.  Hanging from the end of the girl's jacket zipper.  A small plastic cat.

RILEY
I'm looking for a girl.

Allie smirks.

ALLIE
I bet you are.

RILEY
She had a unicorn.  A plastic one like your cat there.  Tied to her boot laces.

Allie stops wiping the counter.  Peers up at Riley.  Studies him for awhile.  Crosses her arms.

ALLIE
What kind of stone is that?

The girl touches the base her neck.  Focuses on Riley's pendant.

RILEY
I don't know.

The girl leans over the counter.  Takes the stone in her fingers.

ALLIE
It's not Lapis.  Azurite maybe.

The girl squints at the stone.  Feels the smooth surface. Deep blues and reds.  Hypnotic.

ALLIE
I'm not sure.  It's beautiful though.  Where did you get it?

RILEY
I don't know that either.

The girl leans back.  Studies Riley some more.

ALLIE
You don't know much, do you?

35.

RILEY
So can you help me?

ALLIE
A girl with a unicorn on her boot laces.  That's not much to go on. Who wants to know?

RILEY
My names is James Riley.

ALLIE
You're military.

RILEY
I used to be.

ALLIE
Let's say I did know a girl that matched your stunning description. I'd say that if you ordered a coffee and waited on the patio for awhile... well she'd either show up or she wouldn't.  You know what I mean, James Riley?

RILEY
I think so.  How's your coffee here?

EXT. SKYRUNNER CAFE PATIO - MOMENTS LATER

Riley sitting at a table on the patio.  A coffee in front of him.  Students and young people at tables all round him.

.MOMENTS LATER

A taller woman in her 30s (MADI) with dark sunglasses and dark hair in a pony tail sits at down the table next to Riley.

The woman puts down her coffee and opens a newspaper.  Lays it out on the table.  Through her glasses it's hard to tell if she's looking at Riley at not.

A beat.

MADI
You were asking about The Sentinel.

At first Riley's not even sure who's talking.  Then see's Madi.

36.

RILEY
I was, yes.

MADI
And about Em.

RILEY
I didn't know that was her name.

MADI
Are you a a spy for Amicus?

RILEY
I'm not a spy.

Madi takes a drink of her coffee.

MADI
What's your name?

RILEY
My name is James Riley.

Madi puts her handbag on the table.  Opens it.

MADI
The doctor told us about you, Lieutenant Riley.  I'd have to say we were very skeptical and still are.

RILEY
Which doctor is that?

MADI
That would be Dr. Miles Temple from your short but thrilling stay at the New Mercy Clinic.

Across the street Riley notices a black sedan with tinted windows.

MADI
Don't worry, they're not here for you.  If they were you'd be in the back of one of their shiny black vans already.

Madi reaches into her handbag.  Removes a flat pen-like device.

MADI
Show me your IDC tag.

37.

Riley puts his arm on the table.  The yellow strip with rows of black numbers.

MADI
What division did you serve in?

RILEY
Third air.

MADI
Ah, urban destabilization.

RILEY
You could put it that way.

Madi touches the pen-like device to Riley's IDC tag and the device beeps once.  Madi picks up her phone and watches the display.

The phone flashes.

The text on the screen reads : GREEN

MADI
Are you ready to go?

A faded blue panel van pulls up in front of the cafe.

INT. VAN - DAY

The van cruises down the city streets.  Delvin is driving. Another man, GAVIN, is in the passenger seat.  He's blonde and is only seen in profile.

Riley is in the back.

Also in the back are Em and Temple.  Sitting on the floor of the van is little girl of about seven (TALLULAH) and beside the girl is Madi.

The van drives further into an industrial zone.

Em studies Temple as the van moves through the streets.  Em's gaze is steady and focused.

After awhile...

EM
That's Delvin driving.  He's our number one.

Delvin gives a wave from the front.

38.

EM
Of course you know the good doctor, Miles Temple.

TEMPLE
I'm glad you made it out of there.

EM
In the passenger seat is Gavin.  He provides the stoic charm.

Gavin turns and we see his face.  Nordic with and chiseled features and blonde, almost yellow hair.

GAVIN
Hallo.

EM
You met Madi at the coffee shop, though I don't suppose you had time to chat much.

Madi has her sunglasses off.  Big brown eyes and a pretty smile.

MADI
It's a pleasure.

Em puts her hand on the little girl's head.

EM
And this... troublemaker...

TALLULAH
I am not!

EM
...is Tallulah.   Madi and Gavin are her parents.

Tallulah waves.

Riley smiles at the girl.

EM
And my name is Em.

EXT. WAREHOUSE - DAY

The van drives down a ramp and stops at a security gate.

A camera watches the van from above.

The gate opens.

39.

INT. WAREHOUSE UNDERGROUND - DAY

Walking through the parking lot.  Em and Delvin leading.

Riley and are Temple behind.  Following them are Madi, Gavin and the little girl, Tallulah.

Arriving at a freight elevator.  Another video camera peers down.  Em looks into it.  Taps on the lens.

EM
Open up, squirrel.

A buzzing sound.  Em slides the elevator grate open.

FRIEGHT ELEVATOR

The team, going up.

NEWSROOM

A huge office space with massive ceilings.  A hundred desks and a hundred or more people all moving about busily, chattering over the sounds of office machines and telephones.

On the wall in huge block letters : EYES OF THE CITY

UPSTAIRS OFFICE

A large office with wide windows that look down over the newsroom.

Everyone is here.  Riley, Em, Temple, Delvin, Gavin and another man (LIONEL) sit around a coffee table.

Lionel is a quirky looking fifty-year-old with a mop of frizzy black hair and round wire rim glasses.

Behind them, at the office-kitchen Madi and Tallulah are making a sandwich.

Lionel stares across at Riley.

LIONEL
So you're the real deal, I'm told.

RILEY
I guess that I am.

LIONEL
A pilot, back from the war who hasn't been through the Amicus de-breifing program.  It's unprecedented.

40.

Lionel studies Riley further.

LIONEL
You're a marked man now though, you know that?

RILEY
It seems that way.

EM
Once the agents get a beat on you they don't stop.  Not until they have you.

A clock ticking on the wall, louder than it should.  Riley stares up at it.  Senses something is off.

Something doesn't feel right.

Riley turns back to Lionel.  It's like a deja-vu.

RILEY
I've seen you before.

Lionel peers into Riley's eyes.

LIONEL
I'm Lionel Grey.  I'm the editor of the Sentinel.  This newspaper.

The clock still ticking on the wall.

RILEY
This is a dream?

Em leans in.

EM
What is?

LIONEL
Do you think you're dreaming right now?

RILEY
I remember this place.  I remember the sound of that clock.

Lionel peers further into Riley's eyes.

LIONEL
Have you ever heard the term Temporal Drift?

41.

Riley seems lost now.  In two places at once.

RILEY
Just stop when you get to 14th ave. There's a bakery there.  I use to go there when I was a kid.

Lionel smiles a knowing sort of smile.

LIONEL
Riley.  Come on man.  Over here. Have you ever heard the term--

RILEY
Temporal Drift.  Guys on Gili were getting it.  Messes with your memory, right?

Em shifts forward.  Studies Riley closer.

EM
Some people think it does more than that.

Em snaps her fingers twice in front of Riley's face.

She flashes a glance at Delvin who is also watching with renewed interest.

EM
How did you know how to find us?

RILEY
What's that?

EM
How did you know how to find us?

Riley blinks like he trying to see what's right in directly in front of him.

Em crosses her legs and when she does we see the figure of the small plastic unicorn.  White with a red mane and long silver horn.

Riley scans the room.

RILEY
I've seen you before.   All of you. I've been here.

Em slide a magazine across the table to Riley.

42.

On the cover a man in his eighties.  A huge smile with his arms crossed, white hair in a lab coat.

The text below reads : ERHARD HESSE, PROPHET OF THE ALPS

RILEY
So what is this?

LIONEL
It's the missing link.

But Riley isn't getting it.

EM
This man studies memory.  Pre-cognitive memory.

RILEY
You mean seeing into the future?

EM
That's exactly what I mean.

Riley opens the magazine.  Pages through it.  Finds the article from the cover.

Pages through the article.

A photo of Hesse standing on a University campus.  Another of him behind a computer peering into the screen.

A photo of Hesse with his wife, Ilsa.  They are standing by a lake with mountains behind them.  Much younger here.  Hesse with dark hair and his arm around his blonde wife.

Other photos of scientific phenomena.  DNA strands.  Charts graphing memory functions.  Pictures of brain patterns and CAT scans.

The last photo.  One of Sara Trainer and Hesse sitting on the porch of a post-and-beam log.  Forrest all around. Sara waves at the photographer.

A caption : OPENING A PORTAL TO THE FUTURE

RILEY
This woman.  This is the woman.

Riley taps at the photo.  At Sara.

RILEY
Who is she?

Lionel seems impressed that Riley is making the connections.

43.

LIONEL
The woman's name is Sara Trainer. She's a reporter.

EM
Sara had been working with Hesse from the beginning.  It was Sara who brought us on board to track the...

Em trails off.

Flashes a look at Lionel and then at Delvin.

RILEY
The what?  Track the what?

DELVIN
Track the Chrysalis.

The room is quiet.  A long beat.

Temple leans forward.

TEMPLE
There were six that came back from Gili manifesting the same cognitive dissonance as you.  Six that we were able to track down.  They had dreams like you did.  Like you have.  Dreams that seemed much more like reality that anything imagined.  Dreams that sometimes came true or that came true only in fragments.

DELVIN
Hesse called them the Chrysalis because of the nature of the DNA mutations.

EM
Sara is in Geneva.  In Switzerland right now.  Covering Hesse's research.

RILEY
Then that's where we have to go.

Lionel produces a packet from his briefcase.  Slides it across the table to Riley.

44.

LIONEL
There is a passport in here that will get you through customs and a ticket to Geneva.  Cash too.  The plane leaves tomorrow.

Lionel looks around the room.

LIONEL
You're all going, James.   All of you together.

INT. JFK INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT - DAY

A busy terminal.

At the security check point long lines of travellers wait for their turn to go through the scanners.

Madi, Gavin and the girl Tallulah have already cleared the checkpoint and are walking hand-in-hand further down the terminal.

Delvin and Em stand together near the front of the line.

Riley is further back.

Temple is further still behind Riley.

Riley thumbs through his papers.  Opens his passport.  The picture staring back at him is him.  The name beside the is not.

It reads : FRANK KERRIGAN

A younger SECURITY GUARD in stands twenty feet away.

The line moves forward.  Delvin and Em each walk through a security scanner.

Two airport staff in white shirts approach the security guard.  They hand the guard a flyer.  Talk with him awhile. The guard nods and seems to understand what they say.

Delvin and Em both are both though their scanners and being patted down.  They look at each other, both noting the guard who is crossing the floor to the line of waiting passengers.

The guard walks slowly from the front of the line.  Checks his flyer.  Studies the people in line.  Carries on further.

Em and Delvin clear the checkpoint and head down the terminal.

45.

DELVIN
Don't turn around.

Em and Delvin walk further.  To rows of chairs at a gate waiting area.  They sit down in chairs facing the security checkpoint they just cleared.

The guard continues down the line.  Stops at a passenger.  A middle aged business man.

GUARD
May I see your passport please, sir?

The business man thumbs through some papers.  Hands the guard a passport.  The guard examines it, briefly.  Hands it back.

GUARD
Thank you.

The guard travels down the line further.

Riley turns slowly and looks back to Temple.  Temple is watching, too.  On edge.

The guard stops near another middle-aged business man.

GUARD
Can I see your passport please?

BUSINESS MAN
Yeah, of course.

The man hands it to the guard.  The guard examines it. Examines the flyer.

Riley getting shifty, now.  Looking for a way out.

Em and Delvin still watching from their seats on the other side.

EM
Just stay cool.  Ride it out.

The guard continues on.  Walks past Riley.  Looks like he's going to keep going.

Then stops.  Turns back.

EM
Fuck.

Walks back to Riley.

46.

DELVIN
We can't lose him here.

The guard examines the flyer.  Looks at Riley.

GUARD
Can I see your passport and boarding pass please?

RILEY
Yeah, sure.

Riley passes the guard his papers.

GUARD
Where are you travelling to? Geneva?

RILEY
That's right.

The guard examines the flyer more closely.

GUARD
Can you step over here with me for a minute?

RILEY
What's this about?

GUARD
Just over here for a minute.

The guard grips Riley's shoulder.

RILEY
Yeah, of course.

Em and Delvin watch.

EM
See you in Geneva?

Delvin nods.

DELVIN
Yeah, see you in Geneva.

Em stands up.  Heads back towards the checkpoint.

The guard is on his radio.  Still holding Riley's arm.

47.

GUARD
(into radio)
Gate 52.  Oh wait, I see you.

Five more guards approach from the east about two-hundred feet away.  From the west another two units approach, maybe fifty feet and closing.

The guard waves at the other units.

GUARD
Right here.

Em exits back through the checkpoint.  Approaches Riley and the guard.

EM
Excuse me.

GUARD
Not now, ma'am.

Em is holding a map.  Walking closer.

GUARD
Step back please.

Em closes the distance.  Stops in from of them.

GUARD
Ma'am step back.

EM
(offended)
I was just wondering if you could help.

GUARD
There's a help desk right behind you.

The other two units thirty feet away and closing.

EM
Oh, really?

Em turns like she's going to leave.  The guard look away.

Then.  Em.  Turns back.  Faster than fast.  Strikes the guard with the palm of her hand dead in the guard's solar-plexus.

The guard stumbles back.   Lets go of Riley.  Gasps for air but get's none.  His eyes in complete shock.  Goes for his sidearm.  Has it out of his holster.

48.

Em takes has the guard's wrist.  Steps sideways.  Twists his arm forward, bringing the guard to his knees.  Em snaps a kick at the his breastplate and the guard goes tumbling backward.

Em has the guard's pistol.

The units on each side moving for Em and Riley.  Em fires two rounds in the direction of the five guards.  Just over their heads.  The guards cower and go down.

Screams from every direction as the passengers react.

Em turns.  Fires two more shots towards the other two approaching guards.

Em grabs Riley by the back of his shirt.  Puts the gun on him. Starts walking backwards, towards the doors.  Like Riley is her hostage.

EM
Stay back, I'll shoot him in the fucking head.

Guards closing from both directions.  Walking towards Em and Riley with their weapons raised.

GUARD
Who does she have?  Who is that?

Em and Riley backing out the airport door.

EXT. AIRPORT TERMINAL - DAY

Taxis and limousines in a queue.  A grey haired woman smokes a cigarette and talks with a younger baggage handler.

Em and Riley exit out the door.  Em still with the pistol on Riley.

The grey haired woman screams and drops her cigarette.  The baggage handler edges towards the wall.

A yellow cab.  Em hurries to the driver window which is open. Puts the weapon to the drivers head.

EM
Out, now!

The driver gets out.  Em enters.  Riley enters the passenger side.  The car tires squeal.  Em pulls a U-turn and heads through oncoming traffic.

49.

INT. YELLOW CAB - DAY

Riley looking over his shoulder.  The guards exiting the airport.

RILEY
Holy shit.  I've never seen anyone move that fast!

EM
Put your seatbelt on.

Em swerves hard.  The taxi jumps up and over a meridian and into a car park.  Riley on his seatbelt.

Em pulls right to avoid a parked car.  Sideswipes a parked van instead.  Sparks fly as the vehicles scrape across each other.

Em jumps another meridian and is on the highway still going against traffic.  Steps on the gas.  Going faster.  Swerves to miss a pickup.  Horns blaring.  Swerves again to miss a sub-compact.

Em driving as fast as she can.  Pulls on to the shoulder of the road.  Cars and trucks blasting past them.

Further in the distance an over pass.  Further past the overpass is another small airport.

EM
You were a pilot right?

Now sirens and flashing lights ahead.

Two police cars about half-a-mile up.  Heading their way.

Further.

The first police car.  Pulls into the grassy areas in the middle of the divided highway.

The second.  Stops on to the same shoulder that Em is driving on.   Setting the cop car and the  cab on a collision course.

EM
Take the wheel.

RILEY
What?

EM
Do it.

50.

Riley takes the wheel.

EM
Shift over.  Put your foot on the accelerator.

Riley shifts over.  Puts his foot on the gas.

The parked police cruiser on the meridian, closing fast.

EM
Stop before you hit that car.

RILEY
What!?!?

Em pulls herself out the driver's window.  Stands on the door frame and then slides over the roof and down the front window so she's on the hood.

Sitting now.  Almost leaning against the front window she raises the pistol.  The police cruiser rushes in.

Em fires into the window of oncoming car.  One, two, three shots punch though the glass.

The car maybe a hundred feet from the cruiser.  Em fires another two shots into the glass.

Fifty feet.  Twenty feet.  Riley steps down the brakes.

Em jumps from the hood.  Keeps firing, advancing at a run towards the cruiser.  The cop pinned down inside.

Em at the drivers side door.  The cop laying down on his seat. Weapon drawn but not aimed.  The cop and Em lock eyes.

Em's pistol raised at the cop.

EM
Throw it on the floor!  Now!

The cop fumbles his weapon to the floor.

On the highway divider.  On the grass.  Another two police approach.  Em see's them.  Peeks up over the hood and fires off two shots toward them.  The rounds kick into the ground at their feet.  The two police scramble back for their car.

Riley.  Standing on the side of the highway as traffic rushes past.

The cop looks at Em though the window.

51.

Em fires into the window three times.  The window shatters.

Em pushes away the broken glass.  Reaches in and opens the door.  The cops has his hands up.  Uninjured but terrified.

COP
Don't shoot!  Don't shoot!

Em reaches in and drags the cop out by his hair.

EM
Walk to your friends.  Stop when you get halfway there.  Hands on your head or I shoot you in the back.  Do you understand?

The cops nods. Shakes his head, nearly hyperventilating.

EM
Go.

The cop starts walking.

EM
(to Riley)
Get in the car.

INT. POLICE CRUISER - DAY

Em hits the lights.  Pushes down on the accelerator.  Another U-turn.  Over the grass divider and back on the highway. This time driving with traffic.  Sirens blaring.

On the police radio.

RADIO
Be aware suspects are heading north on the expressway in a stolen police cruiser.

In the rearview mirror the police cruiser behind them turns and pursues.

Em is focused.  The needle buried on the speedometer.

EM
Why did you go to Gili?

RILEY
What?

EM
You heard me fucker, why?  To pay off your debts, is that it?

52.

In the rearview mirror.  The police cruiser barreling towards them.  Further behind it are three more police cars and a black SUV with lights blazing.

RILEY
I don't remember.

EM
You don't remember or you don't want to say?

RILEY
I don't know.

Em takes a hard right.  On to the off-ramp and towards the over pass.  The airstrip and hangar getting closer.

EM
You were bored.

A beat.

RILEY
What?

EM
You went cause you were bored, cause you had nothing else to do. Is that right?

RILEY
I don't know, maybe.

The car approaches the hangar.  A large building and a runway. A small commercial jet parked outside the building.

EM
Well I'm right or I'm not.  Which is it?

The cruiser screeches to a stop.  A half-a-dozen cars and a SUV closing in on them.

Riley goes to exit.  Em grabs his wrist.

EM
Tell me.

A beat as they lock eyes.

RILEY
Can we talk about this later?

Em lets go.

53.

EXT. HANGAR - DAY

Em and Riley running for the plane.  A Learjet 45 XR.  A sleek ten-passenger business jet.

At the jet.  Em lifts the upper door.  Pulls down the stairs. Riley enters.  Em behind him.

INT. LEARJET - DAY

Riley in the captain's seat.  Flicking switches and adjusting instrumentation.  Out the window the police are seconds away.

Riley presses the red ignition button and the engines fire to life.  The plane moves forward heads down the runway.

The police in pursuit and closing.

Riley accelerates hard and the plane shoots down the runway. A second later and it's in the air.

The police cars in the middle of the runway while the plane flies away.

EXT. ROAD IN THE COUNTRY - DAY

A beat-up pickup truck with a high canopy.  In the back eight farm workers in dusty clothing.  The MEXICAN DRIVER is wearing a straw hat.

The driver squints at the road.  Something large glinting off the highway.

MEXICAN DRIVER
Que madres?

The man in the passenger seat leans forward.

Angled in the middle of the highway is the LearJet.  In front if it are Em and Riley.  Em waves her hand as the truck nears.

The truck stops in front of them.  Em walks to the window.

EM
We ran out of out of gas.  Could you give us a lift to town?

The driver and passenger both squinting at the jet like it's some desert mirage.

EXT. MOTEL / MAINE COASTLINE - NIGHT

A small motel on the coast.

54.

INT. MOTEL - CONTINUOUS

Em on the phone.

Riley standing in front of the TV while the news plays video footage from the car chase earlier.

Photos of Em and Riley from airport surveillance flash on the screen.

EM
Well it's not going to work.  Our faces are plastered over every network in the country.  I shot at the police fucking police for christsake.

Em listening.

EM
I'm looking at us on the TV right now.  If you have an idea I'd really love to hear it.

INT. MOTEL - LATER

The middle of the night.  Riley sleeping.  Another dream.

RILEY'S DREAM

A old woman sits across from Riley at a large oak table. Bright eyes and a kind wrinkled face.

This is ILSA HESSE.

The dreamscape humming like last time.  Objects form and dissolve.  Movement and color that drift into shapes that drift back into shapelessness.

There are others here around the table though their forms are too vague to make out.

Ilsa leans in.  Searching with cool blue eyes.

OLD WOMAN
Can you hear me?

Again.

OLD WOMAN
Can you hear me?

RILEY
Yes.

55.

The scenery changes now.  Brighter.  The sun high in the sky. Behind us a lake and a familiar range of mountains.

Ilsa stands on the edge of the lake and looks out across its vastness.  She turns to us and as she does her features change.

Ilsa becomes young again.  Twenty years old with shining blonde hair and cool blue eyes.

As we move closer the images jump once more.  The form that was Ilsa morphs now into the reporter, Sara Trainer.  Dark hair.  Dark eyes.  That sweet soft smile.

Riley is standing beside her.

SARA
We met first in a dream.  I was here and you were where you are.

And the scene jumps and flickers.  The image of Riley and Sara are gone.  Again we see the young Erhard Hesse and his young wife.

Hesse has his arm around his Ilsa.  The couple turn and look at each other.

YOUNG ILSA
I dreamt that you had died.

YOUNG HESSE
I will die.

YOUNG ILSA
I dreamt that a darkness was upon us.

YOUNG HESSE
Let it come.

YOUNG ILSA
I'm afraid, my love.  Of what will happen.

Hesse looks lovingly on his wife.

YOUNG HESSE
We shall listen to our heart my dear Ilsa and learn how to dream our way free.

The image pulses again.  Back to Sara and Riley.

56.

SARA
You said, This is my heart.

We move in slowly on Sara.  And for the last time her eyes change back into the older Ilsa Hesse.  And we're once again sitting at the table where the dream began.

The old woman peering at us.

OLD ILSA
I'm talking to you now, can you hear me.

RILEY (O.S.)
Yes.

OLD ILSA
What did I say?

RILEY (O.S.)
You said learn how to dream.

Ilsa smiles.  A wide, loving smile.

OLD ILSA
You must bring them here soon.  The forces of darkness are aligning quickly and in greater numbers. Time is not forever.  Time is running out.

INT. MOTEL ON MAINE COASTLINE - NIGHT

Two beds.  Em is sleeping in one.  Riley sits up awake in the other.  The blue and red gemstone tumbles between his fingers.

INT. MOTEL - LATER

Riley is sleeping now too.

RILEY'S DREAM

Riley is standing on a path under a wide forrest.  The dreamscape is similar to the others.  Shifting colors, vague and uncertain.

RILEY
Hello, Em? Em, can you hear me.

EM
I'm sleeping.

57.

RILEY
I've found the way.  It's easier than we thought.  We're only travelling across this plane.  All we have to do is this.

EXT. BEACH - DAY

Tallulah plays bare footed in the water.  Madi, watches from the shoreline.

EXT. GENEVA LAKE HOUSE - DAY

A post-and-beam cabin on a hillside over a wide blue lake. The large veranda wraps around it on all sides.

At the back of the house a porch looks out on a forrest laneway.  The laneway cuts through the trees and is lost.

On the porch Gavin is sitting.  An AK-47 leaned up against his chair.  There is movement down the laneway.

Gavin picks up the rifle.  Stands.

Riley and Em walk towards him.

Gavin steps down off the porch.  A wide, Nordic smile.

GAVIN
What, did you walk here?

INT. LAKE HOUSE - DAY

Huge vaulted ceilings with exposed wooden beams.  Bay windows looking over the lake and mountains.  A spiral staircase that leads to a loft.

On the walls pictures of families, smiling and happy. Vacations, weddings, babies.  A lifetime of memories.

One photo from a long time ago.  A younger man and his wife in front of the lake outside.  The man has his arm around the woman's shoulder.

They are Erhard Hesse and his wife, Ilsa.  The smiling image we have seen before.

Riley at the window.  From here he watches the girl Tallulah splash in the water.  Madi sitting now on, the beach below.

The back door opens.  Riley turns to the door.  Temple enters with an armload of wood.  Notices Riley at the window.

58.

TEMPLE
You made it.  Bravo.

Temple crosses the room to a woodstove.  Drops the wood.

The back door still open.

Riley watches it.

From outside we hear the voice of a woman.  Talking and laughing with Gavin.  Shadows dance across the doorway. Riley watches them as the voices carry inside.

The woman steps through the door.  Bright and smiling and laughing.

Sara.

Sara stops in the doorway.  Her wide dark eyes holding on Riley.  Tender and true.

EXT. BEACH PATH - DAY

A winding path down to the beach.

Tallulah and Madi walk up the towards the house.  Sara and Riley, down.  The four meet on the path.

Madi is glowing as usual.  Tallulah at her side.  The girl is in her swim suit.  Still dripping wet and wrapped in a towel.

TALLULAH
I went in the water.

MADI
She did.

Sara leans over the little girl.  Brushes the wet hair from the girl's eyes.

SARA
Was it fun?

Tallulah nods.  A child's smile.

Madi touches Sara on the shoulder and continues up the path.

MADI
(to Tallulah)
Come on baby.

59.

AT THE BEACH

Sara and Riley look out across the water.  Wide and dark blue.

SARA
I'm not sure what to make of all this.

RILEY
You and me both.

Sara looks on Riley with a careful gaze.  Soft and loving.

SARA
Look at me.

Riley does.

SARA
Do you know why you are here?

RILEY
No.

SARA
This man, Erhard Hesse and his wife, Ilsa.  The research they have done and what they've uncovered. It all leads back to you.

Riley looks down at the sand.  Shakes his head.

RILEY
I don't know what I am supposed to do.

SARA
You know about the Chrysalis?

RILEY
Yes.

SARA
Then you know that you're one of them?

RILEY
If I am then I am.

SARA
It's what Hesse he was writing about before was killed.

60.

  
All this that seems disconnected and random suddenly becomes meaningful.  Whatever is pulling you has meaning, James. You are the most important part of this.

Riley doesn't look so sure.

RILEY
I did terrible things, Sara. Terrible, terrible things that never should be forgiven.

SARA
But they will be, my love.  They must be.

A far away look in Riley's eyes.

RILEY
I heard your voice on that day.  As clear as I can hear it now.  You said...

SARA
I am waiting for you here.

RILEY
How do I know you like this?

SARA
We met first in a dream.  I was here, and you were where you are. You said, this is my heart.

Riley looks into the depths of Sara's eyes.  Removes the stone pendant from his neck.   Put's it in Sara's hand. Holds her hand closed with his own.

RILEY
This is my heart.  Now it belongs to you.

Sara leans into Riley.  Her head rests against Riley's chest.

INT. LAKE HOUSE - DAY

Riley at the center of a large table.  Around the table are Sara, Em, Temple and Delvin.

Everyone is silent.

A figure appears from the top of the staircase.  A female form with white hair who steps down slowly.

61.

The woman rounds the staircase and we see her face.  Wrinkled and timeworn but eyes glowing brighter than a child's.

Ilsa Hesse.

ILSA
I'm coming.  I'm coming.

AT THE TABLE

Ilsa sits next to Riley.  Her strong gaze studying him intently.  The old woman leans closer like she recognizes something familiar in Riley's eyes.

Ilsa grips Riley's hand with hers.

ILSA
My boy, are you ready?

Riley nods.

.MOMENTS LATER

The room transformed into an interview space.  Lights and a camera on a tripod.  A softbox illuminates Riley as he sits in the chair across from Ilsa.

On the table beside Ilsa is a silver case.

Sara adjusts the camera on Riley.

ILSA
Now we'll begin.

RILEY
Yes.

The silver case is open.  Ilsa removes a pair of wire leads from the it.  Attaches them to a silver arm band.  Wraps the band around Riley's forearm.

Removes a syringe.  Sticks the tip of the syringe into a small glass vial.  Pulls the plunger back and sucks up the clear liquid.

Ilsa removes the needle from the bottle.  Holds it up.  Taps at the cylinder.

Ilsa smiles a soft smile and then pushes the needle into Riley's shoulder.  Depresses the plunger.  The liquid disappears into Riley's arm.

62.

A beat before a wave of heat and emotion flood over Riley. His face goes flush.  Blinks like he can't see.  Looking into space.

Ilsa adjusts the machine.  A quiet high-pitched hum sounds.

OLD WOMAN
Can you hear me?

Ilsa touches Riley's knee.

Riley tries to see the woman.  Closes his eyes.  Opens them. Blinks like he's trying to adjust his vision.

ILSA
Can you hear me?

Riley shakes his head quickly back trying to shake off something.

SARA
It's okay.

Ilsa adjusts the machine further.  The high pitched hum gets louder.  Like a ringing in the ears.

Riley swallows.  A wave of awe passing over him.  Breathing now, short shallow breathes.

In-and-out.  In-and-out.  In-and-out.

Then.

Stops.

Relaxes.   A huge exhale and eyes close.

A beat.

Eyes open.  Clear eyes, looking right at Ilsa.

Then.  Something like a red liquid injected now into the whites of Riley's eyes.  Riley's pupils expand like discs. Blood red and black.

Something is looking through these eyes now.

It's Riley but not Riley.

There is an alien presence here.

A crow lands on the outside balcony.

Riley sees it.

63.

The crow turns its head and looks through the window.  Black eyes staring at Riley.  Flaps it wings.  Caws.  Jumps from the banister and is gone.

Riley holds for a beat outside.  Then looks back to Ilsa.

ILSA
I'm talking to you now, can you hear me.

RILEY / ALIEN
Yes.

ILSA
What did I say?

RILEY / ALIEN
You said we will learn how to dream together.

Ilsa smiles.  A wide, loving smile.

ILSA
You must bring them here soon.  The forces of darkness are aligning quickly and in greater numbers. Time is not forever.  Time is running out.

RILEY / ALIEN
The human must do his part.  Where is the stone?

Sara puts the amulet in  to Riley's hand.

It begins to glow softly.

EXT. LAKE HOUSE / VERANDA - DAY

Gavin is on the sitting on the porch when Delvin exits.  The AK-47 across his lap.  Delvin looks at his phone.  Pockets it.

Crosses to Gavin.

DELVIN
It's not that I never cared Gavin, so I don't want you all thinking that.  I was a fighter and I'm still fighting and I don't expect you to understand.

Gavin scowls.

64.

GAVIN
What the hell are you--

DELVIN
Once you see the inside of their prisons something changes in you.

Delvin's eyes glaze over.

DELVIN
I can't have you there.  Not you or Em or Madi.  None of you.  Don't you understand that these people have no souls?

Gavin looks on Delvin with great concern.

GAVIN
What are you going on about, Delvin?  Maybe this isn't such a good time--

Now Gavin sees the pistol at Delvin's side.

DELVIN
There can never be a good time brother.  Only what we have to do and whether or not we have the will to do it.

Gavin peers into the abyss of Delvin's eyes.

INSIDE THE HOUSE

Riley still holding the alien presence.

Something is in the air.  Something is wrong.

Then.  From outside.  Two sharp cracks.

And then something like a realization flashes across Em's eyes.  In the next instant Em is standing.  The Glock 19 hard-target-locked on the back door.

Waiting for _him_ to enter.

No one breathes.

Delvin walks though the door.  Pistol down loose at his side.

Madi stands.   Hand over her mouth.

65.

MADI
Where's Gavin?  Delvin, where is Gavin!

A blank look on Delvin's face.  Madi covers her mouth.

TALLULAH
Where's daddy?

Madi vibrating.

Em still has the Glock locked on Delvin.

EM
Sit down, Madi.

But Madi doesn't seem to hear.

EM
Madi, sit down now!

Temple takes Madi's arm.  Pulls her back into the chair.

Delvin studies Riley.  Riley's eyes are black discs.  Alien eyes.

DELVIN
It's because of this, Em.
(indicating Riley)
I don't know why we cared about them.  The war would have gone away if we had just stayed the hell out of it.

EM
How long do we have, Delvin?

Delvin.  Eyes lost.

DELVIN
We never had a chance.

EM
(yelling)
Before they get here, how long to we have!

DELVIN
Three minutes.  Five maybe.

Tallulah starts to cry.  Face buried in her mother's side.

Em's pistol still trained on Delvin.

66.

EM
Put the gun down.  Let us out of here.

DELVIN
You'll have to shoot me.

EM
You don't think I'll do it?

DELVIN
I know you will, Em.  I'm counting on it.

EM
Delvin, put the fucking gun on the floor!

Delvin.  Defiant eyes.

DELVIN
No.

A beat.

Em fires.  The Glock 19 kicks three times.  All three shots punch though Delvin's chest.  The gun drops to the floor.

Delvin drops to his knees.  Eyes wide.  Falls forward, dead.

On Riley now, as Ilsa regulates the machine.  The high pitched hum settles and goes quiet.

Riley's eyes clear almost at once.

Riley, breathing now, faster.

RILEY
Holy shit.

EXT. VERANDA / LAKE HOUSE- MOMENTS LATER

Madi carries Tallulah out the door.  Em ushers them past Gavin's body, dead on the veranda.

AT THE VAN

Riley, Temple, Em and Ilsa.

Em opens the back sliding door.

EM
Get in, Ilsa.

67.

Ilsa stands where she is.

ILSA
I'm staying.

EM
They'll kill you.

ILSA
If they want to, they will.  I'm not running from this place.  This is my home.

MOTORCYCLE

Madi sits on a motorcycle and pushes away tears.  Tallulah is on the back, face buried in her mother's side.

SARA
I'm so sorry, Madi.

MADI
None of us knew.

Madi starts the bike.  The engine hums.

MADI
I don't know if I'll be in contact again.

Sara smiles at Madi warmly.  Kisses the nape of Tallulah's neck.

Madi puts the bike in gear and it pulls the away and down the lane.

INT. VAN / LANEWAY - DAY

Em driving down the laneway.  Riley in the passenger seat.

Temple and Sara in the back.

FURTHER

The laneway ends at a busy highway.

In the distance we see Madi and Tallulah speeding off on the motorcycle.

Em turns the van in the opposite direction and heads down the highway.

68.

HIGHWAY

Em watches in the rear view mirror.

EM
What do you see?

Riley watches behind them.

RILEY
I don't know.  Nothing.  Just keep driving.

The van merges with more traffic.

Now, the sound of a helicopter.  It drops in low, over the traffic.  Buzzes over the top of the van.  We hear sirens and see two police cruisers headed their way with lights blazing.

The police cars getting closer.

The police cars blast past the van.  The helicopter banks and follows the police cars.

Em watches them go in the rearview mirror.

The police cars stop in the middle of the highway.

A number of police exit and in the next instant are dragging spike belts out across the road.

The helicopter hovers above the police cars.

The van keeps driving.

Safe.

EXT. MOTEL EDELWEISS - NIGHT

A small motel on the edge of Lake Geneva.  Madi's motorcycle is parked out front.

INT. MOTEL EDELWEISS  - NIGHT

On the bed.  Tallulah is watching TV.  Madi sits against the headboard and strokes Tallulah's hair.

TALLULAH
Can I have a bath now?

EXT. MOTEL EDELWEISS - NIGHT

Across the street, a black SUV.

69.

IN THE SUV

Wilson and Bradley.  Wilson is looking through night-vision binoculars.

BRADLEY
Room 14.

WILSON
And which one is she?

BRADLEY
Madison White.  Checked in alone, three hours ago.  That's her bike.

WILSON
And the rest of these vehicles?

BRADLEY
Tourists come to splash in the lake.  The girl is in there alone.

INT. BATHROOM / MOTEL EDELWEISS - NIGHT

Tallulah in the tub.  The water is running.  Madi sits on the edge of the tub as the room collects steam.

PARKING LOT

Wilson and Bradley have exited the SUV.  Are crossing the parking lot.  They both have shotguns at their side.

IN THE BATHROOM

Tallulah in the tub.  Madi looking worn and tired.

OUTSIDE MOTEL ROOM

Wilson and Bradley standing shoulder to shoulder.

Bradley kicks in the door.

IN THE BATHROOM

Sound of a thump.

OUTSIDE MOTEL ROOM

Wilson and Bradley standing in front of the open motel room.

The bathroom door is closed.

Wilson and Bradley enter.  Move towards the bathroom door.

70.

IN THE BATHROOM

Madi stands up.  Walks to the  door.  Listens.

IN THE MOTEL ROOM

WILSON
Open the door and come out Madison.

IN THE BATHROOM

Madi opens the door.  The room is empty.

MADI
Get dressed Tallulah, right now.

IN THE MOTEL ROOM

Wilson opens the bathroom door.  Empty.  Grabs the paper from Bradley's hand.  Studies it.

WILSON
That's nineteen you idiot!

EXT. ROOM 19 / MOTEL EDELWEISS - NIGHT

The upper level.  The door to the room opens.  Madi exits quietly with a backpack.  Tallulah is at her side, holding a doll.

Underneath Wilson and Bradley exit from the other room.

Madi can see their shapes through slits in the walkway.

Madi and Tallulah start walking slowly.

Wilson steps back.   Looks at the room numbers.  Looks up.

Sees shadows now.  Moving through slits in the walkway.

WILSON
Hey!

Madi picks up Tallulah.

MADI
Let's go baby.

Madi and Tallulah start running.

EXT. BEHIND THE MOTEL - NIGHT

Dense forest.

71.

Madi and Tallulah running.  Behind them voices and the sound of pursuers.

TALLULAH
Where are we going?

MADI
We have to run.

Madi holding the girl as they race ahead.

Through the dark.  The moon shining in the sky.

Trees rush by on all side.

.FURTHER

Flashlight beams cut through the darkness behind them.

Madi and the girl sprint through the trees.  Over a small embankment and down.

Madi hits the ground with the girl.  Slides back against the brush.  Footsteps running behind them.

Madi and the girl.  Frozen.

Madi raises her index finger to her lips.  Shhhhhh.

The footsteps slow, then stop.

All is quiet.

Flashlight beams cut through the trees above Madi and the girl.

Fear in Tallulah's eyes.  Madi holds the girl close.  Kisses her.

Wilson and Bradley are just short of the embankment.

Wilson shuffles in the leaves.

WILSON
So?

BRADLEY
So what?

WILSON
They're not running anymore.  That means they're hiding.  How long do you think it would take for us to find them?

72.

BRADLEY
We could wait out here all night I guess.  Till the sun comes up.

WILSON
Till the sun comes up.  Yeah.

A beat.

WILSON
What did you say you loaded into this thing.
(indicating shotgun)
Bradley thinks.

BRADLEY
Uh, that's the t-shot tactical, if I remember right.

WILSON
This is fixed choke?

BRADLEY
Yeah.

Wilson indicates the point below the embankment where Madi and Tallulah are.

Steps up on the embankment.

Madi and Tallulah frozen.  Still hidden in the brush.

Madi reaches.  Ever... so... slowly... into the backpack at her feet.

Wilson points the shotgun down.

WILSON
What's the pattern like at say, eight feet?

Madi hears the voice above her.  Too close.

BRADLEY
I wouldn't want to be downrange to find out, if that's what you mean.

Madi smiles softly at the girl.  Tears in her eyes.

MADI
(hushed)
Wait.

73.

Madi pulls herself up.  Stands below the two agents at the base of the embankment.

Tallulah pushes up against the brush further.  Watches her mother in the moonlight.

MADI
I'll tell you what you want to know.  Whatever you want.

Madi's waistband from behind.  A silver pistol.

WILSON
Oh you will, will you?

MADI
Yes.

Wilson has the shotgun trained on Madi.  Bradley steps up on the embankment.  Trains his shotgun on Madi, too.

WILSON
You people make me sick.  Do you have any idea what you're up against?
(beat)
You think you're fighting for something?  Get up here!

Wilson and Bradley step back.

Madi steps forward.  Climbing the embankment and on to even ground.

Wilson shakes his head.  Spits on the ground.

Then.  The sound of what must be a stick breaking in two.  At the base of the embankment.

Wilson spooked.  He lowers the shotgun to the base of the embankment

MADI
No!

And then.  In a beat of pure adrenalin.

Madi reaches behind her.  Grabs the pistol and fires in it one arc.  A shot into Wilson's shoulder spins him back.

Madi turns and fires on Bradley.  Two shots square into Bradley's chest.  Bradley's shotgun discharges into the ground as he flails back.

74.

Madi's pistol moving again.  Back toward Wilson.  The gun almost on him.  About to fire.

Wilson.  The shotgun of the barrel raised.

KABOOM!

The shotgun round explodes like a bomb.

CUT TO:

INT. BASEL COTTAGE MOTEL - NIGHT

Riley sits up in bed.  Panic.

EXT. FOREST BEHIND MOTEL - NIGHT

Tallulah.  Two hands over her mouth.  Shaking like a leaf.

The girl's mother, Madi, laid out just a few feet away.

Wilson on the ground.  His legs stretched out in front of him. Breathing hard.  Puts pressure on his wounded shoulder with his hand.

WILSON
Bradley!  Bradley, you fuck!

But Bradley isn't moving.

Wilson picks himself up.  Shuffles over to Bradley.  Kicks the body.  No response.

Wilson flips Bradley over.  Dead eyes.

He shuffles to Madi.  Madi's face, twisted and vacant.

Turns in the direction of the embankment.  Steps over the embankment and down.

See's something on the ground.

A doll.

Wilson looks up and into the forest.

Trees in the moonlight.

EXT. BASEL COTTAGE MOTEL - NIGHT

Riley at the van.  Sara exits the motel room.

SARA
I'm coming with you.

75.

EXT. FORREST - NIGHT

Tallulah running through the forest in her nightgown.

Riley driving down the lake road.

EXT. MOTEL EDELWEISS - NIGHT

Wilson dragging his shot-up self to the SUV.

INT. WILSON'S SUV - NIGHT

Wilson driving.  One hand on the steering wheel, one holding a balled up shirt against his shoulder.

Further.  Wilson focused on the road.

Then.  Something up ahead.  Wilson squints.

A small figure, luminescent on the road ahead.

Wilson passes the figure.  The girl, Tallulah walking quickly in her nightgown on the side of the road.

Wilson drives for a beat.  Pulls over on the side of the road. Watches the girl through his rear-view mirror as she pads down the road.

Wilson steps on the gas.  Pulls a U-turn and heads back down the road towards the girl.

INT. RILEY'S VAN - NIGHT

Riley and Sara.  Driving down the same stretch of road.

Up ahead.  The girl Tallulah, walking.  Ahead of her a few hundred feet, a pair of headlights closing.

The girl getting closer.

SARA
Oh, my God.

Riley pulls up behind the girl.

EXT. SIDE OF ROAD - NIGHT

Sara and Riley exit the van.

76.

Wilson's SUV stops in front of the girl.

SARA
Tallulah!

The girl.  Caught now between two sets of headlights.

INT. WILSON'S SUV - NIGHT

Wilson picks up the shotgun from the seat.

Exits the van.

EXT. SIDE OF ROAD NIGHT - NIGHT

Riley has his pistol up first.  Trained on Wilson Riley advances.  Fires twice.

The first shot kicks into Wilson's shoulder and knocks him backwards and to the ground.

Riley fires again. The round punches into what looks like the middle of Wilson's chest.

Wilson collapses forward.

Riley turns now, focusing on the girl Tallulah.  Tallulah has made it safely into Sara's arm.  Riley walks towards them.

From the ground not far away, Wilson raises the shotgun.

Riley doesn't even notice when the blast explodes from the barrel.

The buckshot tears into his back.

RILEY'S DREAM

Riley is back on Gili.  Laid out on a stretcher in a dirty field hospital.  Two dozen more bodies of soliders dead and dying surround him on all sides.

Two young soldiers are here.  Nurses or support staff of some kind.  Riley sees them through his fading eyes.

SOLDIER #1
If he dies what does it mean?

SOLDIER #2
What do you mean, what does it mean?

SOLDIER #1
I mean is he going to die?

77.

SOLDIER #2
Did you see that gash in his chest?

SOLDIER #1
I saw it.

SOLDIER #2
We're all gonna die you know?

SOLDIER #1
Not before I get home.  There's someone waiting for me.

SOLIDER #2
Is she pretty?

SOLIDER #1
Yeah, she's pretty.

INT. MERCY CARE CLINIC - NIGHT

Riley laid out on bed lying on his stomach.  The wounds on his back bound and covered.

INT. TEMPLE'S OFFICE - DAY

Em and Temple watch a news program.  The mood in the room is more than bleak.

ON THE TV

Swarms of law enforcement outside of The Sentinel offices.

Police cars, SWAT vehicles, fire trucks.  Scores of armed officers taking up positions around the building.  Snipers on adjoining rooftops.

A REPORTER stands in front of a barricade.  The massive circus unfolding behind him.

REPORTER
A three days standoff ended just minutes ago at the headquarters of The Sentinel Observer.  The underground newspaper which had recently been declared illegal under the new incitement laws. SWAT breached cargo bay doors and entered with a staggering show of force. Initial reports leave at least seventeen dead including the infamous editor and chief Lionel Gray.

78.

Scores of police lead employees out the building in handcuffs.

REPORTER
The police have arrested remaining staff and as you can see behind me are loading them into vans.  We can assume to be detained for questioning and quite possibly to face charges.  The standoff comes at a time as the new and controversial media "hush-laws" are being passed through congress.

Em and Temple watching, speechless.

INT. TEMPLE'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Em on the computer.  Opens some encryption software.  Then a chat program.  A list of fifty names, all on-line.  Em's avatar (SHADOWRUN) is at the top.

Em clicks on another user (IGLOO) and a chat window appears.

Em taps at the keyboard.

On screen :

SHADOWRUN
I want to change the venue.

IGLOO
It's too late.

SHADOWRUN
We have to.

IGLOO
Where?

The cursor blinks as Em hovers over the keyboard.

SHADOWRUN
Amicus One.

A long beat.

IGLOO
Do you want us dead?

SHADOWRUN
Dead would be a fair price to pay.

79.

INT. MERCY CARE CLINIC - DAY

Riley on the same bed.  This time awake and staring up. Patterns of light dancing on the ceiling above.

EXT. MERCY CARE CENTER - DAY

On the steps of the clinic.  Riley is stands at the top of the stair.  The narrow Chinatown street alive and humming.

Rickshaws, foodcarts, bicycles.

Em appears at the bottom of the stairs and begins to climb.

Riley meets her halfway.

EM
It's settled.  They're all coming and it's going to be tonight.

Em holds out a set of keys in front of Riley.

EM
She's all yours.  Take good care of her.

Em flashes a sort of sad smile like maybe she'll never see him again.

RILEY
I hope they're still alive.

EXT. AMICUS PLAZA - NIGHT

Half-a-block down from the Amicus One building.  Police and security have set up shop outside the plaza.

Riley arrives in the Range Rover.  Pulls up to the curb.

Idles the vehicle.

IN THE RANGE ROVER

Riley watches the police as they meander and look busy.

Turns off the vehicle.  Leans on the steering wheel.

A tap-tap-tap at the window.  An overweight cop (COP #1) with the wrong end of the flashlight against the glass.  The cop is balding and has obviously had a few too many donuts.

The cop peers in.

80.

Riley rolls down the window.

COP #1
If you're here for the protest you should leave now.  It's not going to happen.

A long beat.

RILEY
I'm not here for the protest.

COP #1
Well you still can't park here. Move along.

Riley stares forward.  Not moving.

COP #1
Hey, you deaf buddy?  I said--

Riley opens the car door.  It pushes into the legs of the cop.  The cop steps back.

POLICE
Hey!

Riley gets out of the jeep.

OUTSIDE THE JEEP

Cop with his hand on his sidearm.  Looks pissed.  Riley faces him.

COP #
Put your hands on the hood of the vehicle, sir.

Riley glares at him.

Cop unlatches his sidearm lock.

COP #1
I said--

RILEY
You going to shoot me?

COP #1
Put your hands on the front of the vehicle, now!  The protest is NOT happening and if you don't want--

81.

RILEY
I told you.  I'm not here for the protest.

COP #1
Put your hands on the front of the vehicle, or I will take you to jail right now!

Riley hold still for a beat.  Walks to the front of the car. Hesitates.

Keeps walking.

COP #1
Hey,  hey!

Riley crosses towards the plaza.  The cop follows on Riley's flank.  On his radio now.

COP #1
you see this guy over here?

One of the cops in front of the Amicus building turns in a circle.  Looking for the radio call.

COP #1
This guy, right here.

The officer still flanking Riley.

Riley steps up on the sidewalk.  Approaches the police tape.

The first cop pulls his sidearm out.

Riley goes under the tape.  Crossing the plaza.

The cop raises his pistol at Riley.

COP #1
Okay, that's far enough.

The other cop is walking towards Riley too, as are a handful of others and security.  All drawing their weapons.

COP #1
I said stop!

Now they all have guns out.  Pistols and automatic weapons all trained on Riley.  They're all shouting.

MULTIPLE POLICE
Get Down!  That's far enough!  Get down on the ground!

82.

Riley puts his hands up.  Stops walking.

The cops and security coverage on Riley, dragging him to the concrete.

INT. POLICE CAR - NIGHT

Riley in the back.  Two police stand next to the car.

An agent arrives.  Wilson.

COP #1
He's got no ID.

Wilson leans over.  Looks in the window.

WILSON
We'll take this one.

INT. ELEVATOR - NIGHT

Wilson with Riley.  Riley, hands zap strapped behind his back.

WILSON
Don't worry, I'll kill you properly tonight.

INT. VAN SANT'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Riley standing with Wilson.   Van Sant sits on the corner of his desk.

VAN SANT
You're the last one?

RILEY
I'm the first one, actually.  I just showed up late for the party.

VAN SANT
So what, that makes you Jesus and the other scabs I killed before you the apostles?  Is that it?  Come to deliver the gospel to the people?

RILEY
I shouldn't comment on that.

VAN SANT
You know I tortured the ones we brought in alive.  They all said they same thing give or take.

83.

  
That they didn't know what the hell was going on.

RILEY
And you believed them?

VAN SANT
Yeah, I believed them.  But it was still fun asking.

RILEY
I guess the question now is, do I know what hell is going on?

VAN SANT
Well if you do it hardly matters anymore.  You're the last one, James Riley.  If there is some great cosmic conspiracy it ends with you.

RILEY
But you still want to know.

VAN SANT
Yeah, I still want to fucking know. And Wilson here who you shot all to hell, he wants to know to.

Van Sant taps his foot on the floor.

VAN SANT
You see we followed the work of that Swiss doctor and his cunt wife very closely.  Even tired to replicate their finding in our lab and you know what?

Van Sant smirks.

VAN SANT
Who gives a shit, that's what.  DNA mutations, re-evolutionary morphogenic fields,  psychic fucking feedback loops, divine messengers.  Fuck you.  It's smoke. It's all a lot of smoke.

A beat.

RILEY
But you still want to know.

84.

VAN SANT
Sit him the fuck down.

Wilson pushes Riley into a chair.

EXT. AMICUS ONE - NIGHT

A news van pulls up to where the police barricade has been erected.

A pair of Amicus security arrive a second later at the window. More police and security on the periphery.

Security knocks on the window.

SECURITY
You're joking right?

The reporter shakes his head, no.

SECURITY
This is a media hush-zone, or are you just stupid?

Another van pulls up from another direction.  Different news company.

SECURITY
Wait here.

From down the street a group of ten-or-more young people approach.  Some of them are holding protest signs.

INT. VAN SANT'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Riley in the chair.  His arms up and over the back, shoulders pushed forward.  Wrists still strapped together.

VAN SANT
All our research turned up nothing really.  Our scientists, I think they're idiots when it comes to this.
(beat)
I was particularly upset one night, when a friend of your wouldn't stop blabbering.  I stuck an icepick through one of his lungs when something really amazing happened.

WILSON
Why did you walk in here tonight, I'm wondering?

85.

  
You just came in through the front door and said "Hi honey, I'm home!"

Wilson takes a step towards Riley.  Sits down in a chair across from him

WILSON
What do you remember?

RILEY
I've told you.  Nothing.

WILSON
After your ship went down you remember nothing?

RILEY
That's right.

WILSON
What if I said we didn't believe you?

RILEY
Well you can say what you want, can't you?  It doesn't change the facts.

Wilson nods.

WILSON
You're right.  A fact is a fact. Unchangeable and irrevocable.

Wilson drags his chair across the floor, nearer to Riley. Sits back down.  Leans in.

WILSON
Like the fact of pain, Lieutenant. Physical pain.  I think you'll agree it's a fact all of have to deal with at some point in our lives.

Wilson picks up a long pointed instrument from a tray table. A thin stainless-steel spike with a sliver handle.  We'll call it an icepick.

Riley sees it too.  Shifts in his chair but has nowhere to go.

RILEY
I've told you what I know.

86.

Wilson nods.

WILSON
Maybe you have.  Maybe you have not.  There is a third possibility Lieutenant and that is that maybe you do not know what... you... know...

Wilson takes the icepick.   Touches the tip into the hollow of Riley's shoulder.  Hovers over Riley.  Looks into Riley's eyes.

WILSON
How did you get back to Earth after the accident?  There was no mention of you on any ship manifest.

Riley stares into Wilson's dark eyes and knows what is coming.

Wilson pushes the icepick in.

CUT TO:

EXT. GILI PRISON CAMP - DAY

Dreamscape.

A concrete building surrounded by razor wire with towers along the perimeter.

Riley lying outside of the fence, barely alive.  Shirtless.

The wound down the front of his chest recently stitched up.

Heat rising from his body.

A guard in a tower sees him.

INT. GILI PRISON CAMP - DAY

Hospital ward.  Dirty and ill-kept.  A dozen or more beds all with half-dead patients.

Riley on a steel table.  Still barely conscious.

A doctor is here.  A woman in her forties.  Tired and war weary, though with an air of tenderness.  GRACE wipes his wound with a damp cloth.

Behind her a man in uniform appears.  Fifties, greying hair. Sharp pressed dress jacket with ribbons and silver.  Abrupt.

87.

COLONEL
Which one is this?

GRACE
His name?

COLONEL
I don't care what his name is.  Did you scan his IDC?

GRACE
He's a pilot.  Riley, third division.

COLONEL
Never heard of him.  What's his K-STAT?

Grace holds for a beat.

GRACE
Three.

COLONEL
Three!  What the fuck?
(beat)
How'd he end up outside in the dirt?

Grace shakes her head.

COLONEL
If he's not dead in a hour--

The colonel sighs.

COLONEL
Just make sure he's dead when you ship him next door.

The colonel turns and exits the room.

Grace stares down at Riley.  Riley's chest rising and falling. Then.  Notices something.  A silver chain with a pendant attached to a belt loop.

The charm is a blue lapis stone with a silver bezel.  The doctor rolls it between her fingers.

Someone enters the room.  A young corporal.  Dirty and anxious.

CORPORAL
They said you needed help.

88.

The doctor looks up.

GRACE
Who said I did?

CORPORAL
Well where's he going?

They both look to Riley.  Then Grace looks up at the corporal.

GRACE
He's going on the B-freighter.

The kid smirks.

CORPORAL
The B-freighter is going to Earth, ma'am.

GRACE
I know where it's going, corporal.

CUT TO:

BACK IN VAN SANT'S OFFICE

Riley gasps as Wilson removes the icepick.

EXT. AMICUS ONE - NIGHT

Outside the crowd is growing.  The two news vans have turned into twenty and the small groups arriving have merged into a larger crowd.

News vans have hunkered down, satellites up and ready.

An Amicus agent is on a megaphone.

AGENT
This is an illegal gathering. Disperse now. This is an illegal gathering.  Disperse now.

Continuing as he walks along the periphery of the crowd.

No one is leaving.  Down the street waves new of people arriving.

INT. VAN SANT'S OFFICE - NIGHT

Riley still sitting in the chair.

89.

Wilson holds up the icepick as Van Sant watches.  Wipes off the blood.  Leans into Riley who is shaking off the pain.

WILSON
Hey, come on now.  It wasn't that bad.

Wilson, now.  Steps behind Riley.  Touches the tip of the instrument at the base of Riley's neck.

WILSON
I'm afraid this one will be quite bad.

Wilson plunges the pick downward, between Riley's shoulder blades.

Riley screams.  Gasping.

CUT TO:

INT. GILI HUT - DAY

Through Riley's eyes.  Looking up at a clay ceiling.  Then looking down.  The wound on his chest being stitched now by a pair of slender red hands.

Alien hands.

The hands move slowly and carefully.  Pulling thread from a spool and closing the gap in Riley's chest.

FLASH FURTHER

Riley walking now through a Gili village.  Shirtless.  Hands flat over his chest.  Over the stitched up wound.

It's a dream or a vision.  Floating through this strange landscape.  Gili aliens on all sides.  Men, women and children.  They watch Riley with birdlike curiosity and wide blue eyes.

Slender red hands reaching out to touch Riley as he passes.

FLASH AGAIN

Nighttime around a roaring fire.  Riley sits cross-legged, amongst a group of a hundred Gili villagers.  There is something being chanted now.

In strange alien tongues.

The sound of a drum.  Boom, boom, boom.  The steady beating rhythm slowly increasing it's tempo.

90.

The chanting get louder as the drum beats faster.

Riley glowing in the firelight.  All eyes on him.

The crowd separates.  Another alien appears.   This one is different.  More magical even than the rest.  Feathers and ornaments of precious metals with intricate carvings.

The shaman is dancing.

Lifts his rattle, shaking it at the sky.

Stomping now.  Red skin.  Blue eyes like lapis.

The shaman dances closer.  The drum beat intensifies.

Riley's eyes hypnotized by the vision before him.

Then.  Silence.  The moon showers down on them.

The shaman crouches before Riley.

Dips his fingers into a small leather pouch.  On the shaman's fingers is a fine black powder.

The shaman wipes the coal-like substance across Riley's forehead leaving three black trails.

Crows something, strange and bird-like into Riley's ear.

CUT TO:

INT. VAN SANT'S OFFICE - NIGHT

The sound of the shaman's song morphs into the shrill of Riley's screams.

Wilson has the instrument pushed as far in as it will go. Still he's pushing harder.  Rotates on the icepick so he's facing Riley.  Looking into Riley's screaming eyes.

WILSON
(screams)
Hey!

Riley's eyes open.  Wide and clear.

Then.  The eyes change.  The pupils expand all at once.  The the red liquid, the same as last time injected into the whites.

Riley gasps.

91.

VAN SANT
There it is.

Wilson lets go of the icepick, leaving it embedded in Riley.

Raises his hands.  Steps back.  Studies the phenomenon before him.

WILSON
There he is!

VAN SANT
I knew you would come.

Riley breathing.  Eyes up now.  Wide and alien.  Red with black discs.

RILEY/ALIEN
Yes.

Two voices at once, merging harmonically.

VAN SANT
Good.

Riley's breathing slows.

Wilson removes the icepick.  Riley shrieks.

Wilson steps back.  Still peering into the dark eyes.  Drops the icepick on the floor.

WILSON
This is some crazy shit.

EXT. AMICUS ONE - NIGHT

Thousands of people now, all up and down the block.

A reporter in front of the crowd.

REPORTER
The protest which was originally intended to be held in Tempest Park had it's venue changed to directly outside the Amicus One building.  A slap in the face directed not only against the new hush-laws but also against the Amicus corporation itself.

We see Em now, moving through the crowd.  She see's people she knows, smiles, says hello, keeps moving.

92.

Further, at a news van.  Em with a group of protesters.

EM
Listen, riot cops are going to be here soon.  Be ready for anything. I mean that.  Anything.

INT. AMICUS ONE - NIGHT

Riley breathing.  Still large dark eyes.

RILEY/ALIEN
We are here to deliver a gift of peace.  Are we in the presence of those who would receive this gift?

Van Sant laughs.  Throws up his hands.

VAN SANT
Oh, peace is it?

RILEY / ALIEN
Yes.

VAN SANT
Peace, now?  Because you're strapped to a chair and nearly dead.

RILEY / ALIEN
We are not dead.  Not nearly.  Our numbers are many.  Here and away.

VAN SANT
You cannot win this war.

RILEY / ALIEN
We do not seek war.

VAN SANT
Then how do you expect to win?

RILEY / ALIEN
We do not expect to win.

VAN SANT
You will be run into the ground like you have been.  Crushed and forgotten.  Dust!

Van Sant screaming.

93.

VAN SANT
What is your mission on this planet?

RILEY / ALIEN
We are here to deliver a gift of peace.

Van Sant frustrated to the end.

VAN SANT
Get them in here.

EXT. AMICUS ONE - NIGHT

Thousands of people outside.  The streets are jammed.

Protest slogans chanted.  Cameras and news crews everywhere.

A helicopter flies over head.  It's spot light zig-zagging across the crowd.

INT. VAN SANT'S OFFICE - DAY

Wilson drags Sara in by her hair.

Sara has been beaten.  Dried blood on her face.  Bruises. Hands strapped behind her back.  Following close behind is the girl Tallulah.

Crying and still in her nightgown.

Riley stands up as he sees them.

Van Sant takes Sara.  Holds her by the back of her hair.

VAN SANT
(indicating Riley)
Get him back down.

Wilson pulls Riley down into the chair.  A cable around Riley's neck.

Wilson Pulls tight.

Van Sant has the icepick now.  Holding it to the back of Sara's neck.  Van Sant pushes Sara to her knees.  The girl falls beside Sara, holding her.

VAN SANT
I need to understand, that's all and I need someone to explain it to me in simple terms.

94.

Van Sant pushes the tip harder into Sara's neck.

Riley and Sara, eyes locked.

Then.  The room begins to rumble.  A slow bass-like sound that rattles everything.

Like the onset of an earthquake.

VAN SANT
(to Riley)
You don't like this, do you?

The room rumbling still.

VAN SANT
Well I don't care.

Van Sant now, pushes the tip of the icepick further into Sara neck.  Sara screams.

Then.

A blast.  A shockwave from Riley's center.  A explosion of light and sound that blast like a bomb out and away.

The blast hits Wilson first.  Kicks him off the ground and sends him back through the air.  Smashing into a wall.

The blast reaches Sara and the girl next.  Then Van Sant. Hits them too.  Kicks them backwards.  Tosses them like rag dolls, tumbling along the floor.

The blast continues.  Reaches the windows of the office. Through the  windows and out.

Glass exploding outwards.

EXT. AMICUS ONE - NIGHT

From the ground the window can be seen blasting out.

Screams of surprise from the crowd.

INT. AMICUS ONE - NIGHT

The windows gone.  The night wind howling in.

Riley is up.  Still with dark, red eyes.  Hands no longer bound.  Facing Wilson.

Wilson.  Battered and broken.  Leaned up against the wall.

95.

Van Sant, Sara and the girl.  All near the blasted window. Van Sant pulls himself to a seated position.  Blood runs from his ear.

Wilson who is just half alive.  Raises a pistol at Riley.

Aims.

SARA
No!

CRACK.  A shot bursts from Wilson's pistol.

Slow motion now.  On the projectile as it heads for Riley.

Sara.  Hands forward rushing at Riley too.

Van Sant standing now.  Near the window.  The girl Tallulah next to him.

The bullet rushing at Riley.

On Riley as the bullet nears.

Then.

Another shockwave.   Blasts from Riley's center.  The shockwave ripples outward in a sharp explosion.  Reaches the bullet.

The bullet tumbles.  Off it's course and wide.

The shockwave.

Now reaching Sara and Van Sant and the girl.  Hits them all. Carries them. Pushing them tumbling through the now blown out window.

Further into the night sky.  Careening out into the void.

Sara holding the girl as they tumble out.

Eighty-seven floors up.

And for less than an instant it seems like they might not fall.  And then they fall.

Riley runs for the window.  Closer.  Running.  Reaches the edge.  Jumps.

FROM THE GROUND

Figures falling.  Screams and shouting  Cameras pointing now. Up at the falling figures.

96.

Em looking up.  Eyes wide and unbelieving.

IN THE SKY

Riley.  Falling fast.

Sara and the girl falling too.  Van Sant tumbling below him.

Now.  Something like an electricity forming in an arc under Riley.

The arc grows larger.  Brighter.  Encapsulates Riley in a pod of electric light.  Crackling blue and white.  It blasts downwards.

A tail of blue fire behind it as it falls.

The pod speeds faster.  Reaches Sara and the girl.  Pulls them into it's field.  The ground rushing in now.  The the pod closing on Van Sant.

The ground closer and closer.

The light pod hits the ground and--

CUT TO:

EXT. AMICUS RECRUITING STATION - DAY

The office is on a busy city street.  A poster in the window show a soldier decked out in combat gear.  The soldier stands on an unfamiliar, alien vista.

The caption read : BRAVE NEW WORLD

Riley, looking at the poster.

INT. AMICUS RECRUITING STATION - DAY

Riley sits at a desk.  The RECRUITER sits across from him.

RECRUITER
Why do you want to go to Gili?

Riley's attention is elsewhere.

RILEY
What's that?

RECRUITER
I said, why do you want to go to Gili?

97.

RILEY
I don't know.  Why not, right?

RECRUITER
You don't know why you want to go?

RILEY
Well why does anyone go?

RECRUITER
There are a lot of reasons, I guess.  Number one would be duty. I would say.  A duty you have to protect you nation and your planet.

Riley nods.

RILEY
Yeah, that's it.  Write that down.
(a beat)
How much does it pay?

The recruiter studies Riley.  Pushes a brochure across the table.

RECRUITER
As a pilot you would start at pay-grade four.

Riley looks impressed.

RILEY
Seriously?

RECRUITER
You'll be flying combat missions mostly.

The recruiter looks pleased with himself now.

RECRUITER
The truth is we haven't lost a pilot since the war began.  It's mostly a turkey shoot, really.

Riley nods.

RILEY
Well, that sounds fine to me.  Do I need to sign something?

On Riley as the recruiter pushes some forms towards him.

98.

RILEY
How long will I be gone.

RECRUITER
It's a three month deployment.

Now.  In the background and far away from here. The chanting begins.  The slow rise of drums beating.  A steady BOOM-BOOM-BOOM.  Melodic and strange and haunting.

Alien songs.

CUT TO:

EXT. GILI VILLAGE - NIGHT

Riley sitting on the ground in front of the fire.  The drums and the chanting continue.

The Gili shaman wipes his fingers across Riley's forehead. Three streaks of the black charcoal trail across.

The alien's wide blue eyes searching in Riley's own.  The shaman leans closer and now we see.   Wrapped around the alien's wrist.

A silver chain with a blue gem stone.

The shaman holds the stone up to Riley's forehead.

Whispers a final song in Riley's ear.

CUT TO:

EXT. AMICUS ONE - NIGHT

A trail of blue fire leads from the 87th floor to the ground.

On the ground a wide blue electric disc.  Pulsating and vibrating.   Crackling and alive.  Two hundred feet wide.

The crowd pushes back.

Now through the disc something shimmers and comes into focus. And there's no mistaking it.  Grass.  Tall and green. Shining from beyond the portal.

On Em.  Wide eyed and amazed.

Looking closer.   Shimmering through the electric blue. Three figures standing on the grass.  They look up though the portal.

99.

EXT. THE ALIEN PLANET OF GILI - DAY

Wide plains of lush green fields.

The portal open.  Wide and electric.

Riley, Sara and the girl Tallulah stand on the periphery. Grass blowing all around them.   Red and yellow clouds paint kaleidoscopes above.

Riley.  Eyes clear and bright.

Sara shocked and unbelieving.   Riley holds her close.  Riley picks up the girl.  The three of them gazing into the electric blue light.

On all sides of them the Gili aliens approach.  Moving slowly in groups.  Raising their arms in gestures of friendship.

NEWS SEGMENT

Video footage of the portal outside Amicus One.

We'll hear audio now from different news reporters.  Men and women, both. Still holding on image of the portal.  Glowing blue and electric.

REPORT ONE
Science fiction has become fact today as the nations of the world witness together in awe and amazement the first inter-world portal...

The video image flickers.  Still on the portal but now we are seeing troops file out from the center.

REPORT TWO
A military withdrawal never seen or frankly never imagined even in the strangest of man's dreams...

REPORT THREE
Reports today coming back from Gili soldiers recounting unimaginable horrors inflicted by the Amicus corporation on their own troops. We're hearing stories of, if you can believe this...

100.

REPORT FOUR
Amicus CEO and chairman Karl Van Sant still missing today in the wake of the amazing and frankly unbelievable events that happened outside the Amicus towers...

REPORT FIVE
A story as old as time itself, I'd imagine and not one that any of thought we'd witness in this life.

The video image flickers.  Again on the portal but now we see a group of Gili aliens filing out.  One of them is holding a glowing white sphere.

REPORT FIVE
The Gili ambassadors arriving today bearing gifts from their homeworld. There may be some skeptics still out there but I think we're all coming to agree.  These being are not here hurt us.  That indeed, they are our friends.

Hold on the portal as the aliens arrive.

>FADE OUT.
